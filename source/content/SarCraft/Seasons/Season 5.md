Code_Name : Age of revolution

In the long and storied history of SarCraft, few chapters stand as infamously as Season 5 - a period that would come to be known as **"The Age of Revolution."** What began as a peaceful vanilla server would transform into a battleground of political intrigue, ruthless power plays, and perhaps the most legendary admin abuse ever witnessed in SarCraft history.

## Age of Peace

When the server first launched on April 2nd, 2022, nobody could have predicted the chaos that would unfold. The season began with a new experimental telegram authentication system crafted by Udit 
### spawn mason activities

In these early days, a group that would come to be known as the Spawn Masons emerged as the dominant force. [[iBattus]] and [[invisble715]] established themselves as active builders while the server's admin, [[shihaam_me]], struggled with the most basic survival mechanics. The enigmatic [[CatMDV|Cat]] joined these pioneers as they constructed essential infrastructure at spawn.

The Masons' ambition grew quickly, though not without setbacks. [[iBattus]]'s failed attempt at constructing a nether portal became the first of many mishaps that would plague the season.

![[failed portal.jpg]]

[[iBattus]]'s failed portal - an omen of the chaos to come


Under [[CatMDV]]'s leadership, the Masons established crucial farming infrastructure - the first spark of civilization in this untamed world.

## [[WhoIsFishie]] joins the server

On April 19th, a player joined who would forever alter the course of SarCraft history - **[[WhoIsFishie]]**.

Within moments of joining, [[WhoIsFishie]] established dominance through bloodshed. The first victim? An unsuspecting [[shinwo_o]], whose death would mark the beginning of [[WhoIsFishie]]'s reign of terror.

![[shin_ded.jpg]]

Setting base just outside spawn on the ocean, [[WhoIsFishie]] established what would become his notorious pattern - fishing endlessly while occasionally emerging to inflict chaos upon the server's inhabitants.


### The Hamkercat Massacres

What followed was one of the most one-sided feuds in server history. TheHamkerCat found himself systematically hunted by Fishie, dying repeatedly in what can only be described as a territorial bloodbath:

[[WhoIsFishie]] kills [[TheHamkerCat]] 

[[WhoIsFishie]] kills [[TheHamkerCat]] 

[[WhoIsFishie]] kills [[TheHamkerCat]] 

[[WhoIsFishie]] kills [[TheHamkerCat]] 

[[WhoIsFishie]] kills [[TheHamkerCat]] 

The carnage was briefly interrupted by a declaration that [[WhoIsFishie]] would cease the killing if [[TheHamkerCat]] stayed away from his territory. The peace lasted mere moments before:

[[WhoIsFishie]] kills [[TheHamkerCat]] 

[[WhoIsFishie]] kills [[TheHamkerCat]] 

In an act of either bravery or foolishness, [[TheHamkerCat]] attempted to claim [[WhoIsFishie]]'s base as his own - a decision that would prove disastrous.

Not even the server admin was safe from [[WhoIsFishie]]'s wrath. When [[shihaam_me]] extended an invitation to his base, the admin found himself drowning while fleeing from [[WhoIsFishie]], who pursued him wielding nothing but a fish as a weapon. This absurd death would foreshadow the admin's many mortalities throughout the season.

## [[WhoIsFishie]] meets [[iBattus]]

As the season progressed, an unexpected partnership formed between the server's most feared player and one of its founding members. [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]] found common ground, beginning a cooperation that would bring prosperity to both - for a time.

## MOUNT BOOBIES INCIDENT

Perhaps one of the strangest episodes in Season 5 occurred when [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[shihaam_me]] embarked on an adventure, discovering a peculiarly shaped landmark that would be christened "Mount Boobies."  

![[boobs.jpg]]

What transpired at the summit would become the stuff of SarCraft legend. After a bizarre conversation about animal slaughter practices, [[WhoIsFishie]] offered the admin a fish:

`SarCraft Server, [23-Apr-22 1:47 AM]`
`WhoIsFishie: anyways shihaam`

`SarCraft Server, [23-Apr-22 1:47 AM]`
`WhoIsFishie: you know how they feed the animals water`

`SarCraft Server, [23-Apr-22 1:47 AM]`
`WhoIsFishie: and food`

`SarCraft Server, [23-Apr-22 1:47 AM]`
`WhoIsFishie: before killing`

`SarCraft Server, [23-Apr-22 1:47 AM]`
`shihaam_me: take me home`

`SarCraft Server, [23-Apr-22 1:47 AM]`
`WhoIsFishie: eat this fish`

`SarCraft Server, [23-Apr-22 1:48 AM]`
`WhoIsFishie: eat the food sar`

`SarCraft Server, [23-Apr-22 1:48 AM]`
`WhoIsFishie: eat`

`SarCraft Server, [23-Apr-22 1:48 AM]`
`shihaam_me: still hungry`

`SarCraft Server, [23-Apr-22 1:48 AM]`
`WhoIsFishie: ill send you home soon`

`SarCraft Server, [23-Apr-22 1:48 AM]`
`shihaam_me was burnt to a crisp whilst fighting WhoIsFishie at (851 156 -33).`

The ritual sacrifice atop Mount Boobies was complete.
## Business relations gone wrong

As [[iBattus]] and [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] continued their partnership, suspicion grew. During the construction of a bamboo farm, iBattus noticed [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]]'s pickaxe seemed unusually efficient. When questioned, [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] claimed it was simply "the gaming chair" that gave him the edge.

[[iBattus]]'s suspicions grew, but Fishie deflected all requests to examine the tool. The opportunity to investigate would come in the most unexpected way - when server lag kicked [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] offline, [[iBattus]] placed a block at his logout position.

![[ibut_killfish.mp4]]   
The suffocation trap that exposed Fishie's hacked gear


When [[WhoIsFishie]] returned, he began suffocating. [[iBattus]], seeing an opportunity, allowed his "ally" to die - gaining access to his inventory and confirming his suspicions: [[WhoIsFishie]] was indeed using hacked equipment.

## Calm before the storm

A period of relative peace followed as [[flowerrthiccc]] joined the server, with [[iBattus]] helping the newcomer establish themselves. During this time, players began to comment on [[WhoIsFishie]]'s unusual absence - a rare occurrence that many would later recognize as the quiet before the tempest.

![[Pasted image 20250216131101.png]]


#### [[iBattus]] Dies

Meanwhile, [[iBattus]] and [[invisble715]] ventured into the nether, where disaster struck. [[iBattus]] found himself in a deadly predicament, dying multiple times in attempts to recover his items. When [[flowerrthiccc]] attempted a rescue, they too perished, continuing SarCraft's long tradition of [[Season 3#Operation Search And Rescue|failed rescue missions]] .


### Stuck in holes
Expanding his influence, [[WhoIsFishie]] began inviting new players to the server - [[TheHarryG]], [[Buhkiru]], and [[StrawBwabii]]. 
What seemed like hospitality soon revealed itself as another scheme when [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[TheHarryG]] became trapped in a bedrock hole after a pearl teleportation plan went awry. Only [[CatMDV]]'s intervention saved them from an eternity in the void.

## The Crash of May 3

On May 3rd, 2022, at precisely 11:15 PM, disaster struck. The server crashed while players were online, marking the beginning of a crisis that would reshape the power dynamics of SarCraft forever.

#### 11:15 PM

## Stuck in the nether

![[stuck_1.jpg]]
![[save_2.jpg]]

The server's troubles continued as [[Buhkiru]] became trapped in the nether's bedrock layer. When [[ButtercupHoney]] attempted a rescue ([[WhoIsFishie]] being "busy"), they too became trapped. [[TheHarryG]] joined the growing list of the bedrock's prisoners, creating a crisis that remains mysteriously resolved to this day - no one knows exactly how they escaped.
## Shutdown of May 10

On May 10th, SarCraft faced an unprecedented situation - administrative bankruptcy. With [[shihaam_me]] unable to pay server bills, the world went offline until donations reached the required MVR 371. Players rallied, meeting the goal within minutes, but the incident exposed the fragility of SarCraft's infrastructure.

## The Reset of May 13

Then came May 13th - a date that would live in infamy. At 4:34 PM, [[TheHarryG]] logged in to discover the unthinkable: the world had reverted to an old backup. Investigation revealed that backups had not been functioning for 10 days, with the server running on a May 3rd, 11:14 PM backup.

#### Deleted builds

he devastation was immense - [[StrawBwabii]]'s bridge and [[flowerrthiccc]]'s trading hall vanished overnight, eradicated from existence.

>So we lose all....
[[iBattus]]


>I would like to apologize once again and I will do everything to make sure this never happens again.
[[shihaam_me]]

## Fishurance 
In true opportunistic fashion, [[WhoIsFishie]] attempted to capitalize on the disaster by announcing "Fishurance" - an insurance plan requiring players to pay him one diamond daily for protection against future server incidents. Unsurprisingly, there were no takers.

## THE REVOLUTION


> [!NOTE] Watch Full Revolution Arc
> ![Youtube](https://youtu.be/wFvl39LDiqg?si=lwNo5Dcb9x4PJm2B)


As tensions reached a breaking point, [[TheHarryG]] and [[WhoIsFishie]] renewed demands for compensation. The admin created a poll to determine the server's stance - with 6 voting against compensation and 5 in favor.

What proved especially inflammatory was [[iBattus]]'s decisive vote against compensation. As a fellow admin who had previously accused [[WhoIsFishie]] of hacking, his opposition was seen as a betrayal by the revolutionary faction. The server split into two opposing camps, with [[iBattus]] loudly proclaiming that compensation would be "unfair."

For [[WhoIsFishie]], this was not merely a poll result - it was a kill list, with [[iBattus]] now at the very top.

The revolution began with lewd constructions on [[shihaam_me]]'s base, but this was merely a distraction from the real plan brewing in the shadows. Operation Bamboo was about to commence.


![[bamboo threats.jpg]]
_The revolutionary manifesto that would change SarCraft forever_

The strategy was ingenious in its simplicity: plant countless bamboo at the admin's base, creating a lag machine that would activate when [[shihaam_me]] logged in to remove it. Above this bamboo forest, lava traps waited at world height, ready to rain destruction should the admin attempt to clear the bamboo.

[[TheHarryG]] and [[flowerrthiccc]] joined the revolution, transforming it from a one-man vendetta into a full-scale uprising. For two days, Operation Bamboo continued, culminating in [[shihaam_me]]'s death by sky lava.

![[Pasted image 20250216154733.png]]

With one admin neutralized, the revolutionaries turned their attention to [[iBattus]], who made a fateful declaration:

> "if i die from u guys, ill admin abuse"

[[WhoIsFishie]] and [[flowerrthiccc]] ambushed [[iBattus]], forcing him to combat log. Seizing the opportunity, [[WhoIsFishie]] encased [[iBattus]]'s logout position in obsidian, creating a second administrative hostage.

Despite being at half a heart, [[iBattus]] refused to surrender. [[shihaam_me]] declined to intervene, abandoning his fellow admin to his fate. In a desperate move, [[iBattus]] logged in on an alternative account to rescue himself from captivity.

When [[shihaam_me]] returned to confront [[WhoIsFishie]], the admin met another humiliating defeat - killed by thorns damage from [[WhoIsFishie]]'s armor.

#### THE SURRENDER

A new vote demonstrated the revolution's success - 80% of players now supported compliance with [[WhoIsFishie]]'s demands. Only [[shihaam_me]] voted to exile the revolutionary leader.

After exhaustive negotiations, the admin finally capitulated, requesting that players provide the exact commands for their desired compensation items - a last show of administrative apathy.

In a historic moment of manipulation, TheHarryG tricked shihaam_me into running a complex command:
>/cli give TheHarryG chest{BlockEntityTag:{Items:[{Slot:0,id:totem_of_undying,Count:1},{Slot:1,id:emerald_block,Count:64},{Slot:2,id:trident,Count:1,tag:{Enchantments:[{id:unbreaking,lvl:3},{id:impaling,lvl:5},{id:riptide,lvl:3},{id:mending,lvl:1}]}},{Slot:3,id:netherite_block,Count:3},{Slot:4,id:ender_chest,Count:64},{Slot:5,id:diamond_block,Count:9},{Slot:6,id:iron_block,Count:64},{Slot:7,id:iron_block,Count:64},{Slot:8,id:golden_apple,Count:64},{Slot:9,id:gold_block,Count:64},{Slot:10,id:observer,Count:64},{Slot:11,id:piston,Count:64},{Slot:12,id:sticky_piston,Count:64},{Slot:13,id:black_shulker_box,Count:1},{Slot:14,id:totem_of_undying,Count:1}]}} 1

The execution of this command was the final straw for [[iBattus]], who immediately resigned from his administrative position.

Not to be outdone, [[shihaam_me]] ran another command granting Fishie his own rewards:
>/cli give WhoIsFishie chest{BlockEntityTag:{Items:[{Slot:0,id:emerald_block,Count:2},{Slot:1,id:gunpowder,Count:64},{Slot:2,id:golden_carrot,Count:64},{Slot:3,id:slime_ball,Count:32},{Slot:4,id:ghast_tear,Count:32},{Slot:5,id:diamond_chestplate,Count:2,tag:{Enchantments:[{id:protection,lvl:10},{id:thorns,lvl:5},{id:unbreaking,lvl:20},{id:mending,lvl:1}]}}]}} 2



## Admin Power Trip

![[power_trip.png]]
_The message that heralded the most chaotic hour in SarCraft history_

What followed would become the most notorious hour in server history. Armed with newfound command knowledge, shihaam_me unleashed an unprecedented administrative rampage:

- WhoIsFishie and TheHarryG were temporarily banned for entering the End to collect shulker boxes
- Random players received creative mode privileges without warning
- Lightning strikes smote players across the map
- Most dramatically, an Ender Dragon was spawned into the overworld "because he was bored"

For sixty minutes, anarchy reigned. The revolution had succeeded in its goal of compensation, but at what cost? The admin had transformed from a hands-off leader into a chaotic deity.

## Aftermath

Eventually, [[shihaam_me]] returned to survival mode and retreated to a distant village - only to accidentally stumble upon [[WhoIsFishie]]'s hidden base. Unable to eliminate the admin without revealing his coordinates, [[WhoIsFishie]] was forced to ask [[shihaam_me]] to simply leave.

Meanwhile, [[iBattus]] finally escaped his obsidian prison with [[invisble715]]'s assistance.
![[ibut escapes.jpg]]


The server's inhabitants soon discovered the most visible consequence of the admin's power trip - an Ender Dragon circling spawn. In a rare moment of unity, players gathered to defeat this unexpected threat.

## [[WhoIsFishie]] vs [[iBattus]]


> [!NOTE] Watch Full Fight
> ![Youtube](https://youtu.be/PlaMzSOT1Io?si=5c2bqX3nVRduoLWM)


Tensions between [[iBattus]] and [[WhoIsFishie]] culminated in a challenge - a one-on-one duel at spawn. Both players entered the arena with hacked clients activated.

The battle began catastrophically for [[iBattus]], who was immediately assaulted by phantoms while [[WhoIsFishie]] seized the advantage, eliminating one of [[iBattus]]'s totems. When [[Kuruzu_]] logged in to spectate, a paranoid [[iBattus]] attacked the observer, prompting retaliation with rocket launchers that sent the former admin fleeing.

Throughout the fight, [[iBattus]]'s lack of hacking expertise proved disastrous - his auto-tool feature repeatedly sabotaged his combat effectiveness as he burned through multiple totems.

After the duel, iBattus accused [[WhoIsFishie]] of taking no damage, unaware that his opponent was consuming golden apples for resistance effects.

This would be the first of several confrontations, each ending with [[iBattus]] either retreating or combat logging.
## Wither on the lose
In yet another escalation, [[WhoIsFishie]], [[Kuruzu_]], and [[flowerrthiccc]] traveled to a mushroom island to unleash multiple withers. The situation rapidly spiraled beyond their control, adding another chapter to Season 5's legacy of chaos.
## Crystal pranks

[[WhoIsFishie]] continued his campaign of mischief by repeatedly convincing [[TheHamkerCat]] that end crystals were harmless pets, leading to at least four explosive deaths. This torment was followed by yet another attempt to sell [[TheHamkerCat]] a "house."
## Ethics of farming

The server witnessed an unusual philosophical conflict when [[WhoIsFishie]] refilled [[flowerrthiccc]]'s house with chickens, only for her to eliminate them on ethical grounds. In response, [[WhoIsFishie]] implemented a chicken breeding system designed to replace each slain bird with two more - a poultry hydra that threatened to overwhelm the server.
## [[iBattus]] Lurking

Despite officially leaving the server, [[iBattus]] remained a presence in the group chat, engaging in arguments with active players. After viewing [[WhoIsFishie]]'s gameplay footage, [[iBattus]] renewed accusations of hacking - unaware that his nemesis was not only using hacked clients but also exploiting duplication glitches.
## Egg
In a rare defeat for [[WhoIsFishie]], [[Nathuf_Nazim]] managed to raid the End and claim the dragon egg before the infamous revolutionary could acquire it.

## End of the Season
Unlike previous seasons with their dramatic conclusions, Season 5 ended not with a bang but with a whimper. Player interest gradually waned, and the server experienced increasingly frequent downtimes that went unnoticed as fewer players logged in.

One day, without ceremony or announcement, the server simply shut down - the final chapter in the most revolutionary season of SarCraft history.
