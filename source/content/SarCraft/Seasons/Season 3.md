Code_Name : Middle Ages

In the chaotic aftermath of [[Season 2]]'s explosive finale, a new world emerged from the digital ashes. The slate had been wiped clean, and with it came new promises of order, stability, and peace. [[shihaam_me]], the server's often-absent creator, had returned to take his rightful place as administrator. Hacks were officially outlawed, and for a brief, fleeting moment, it seemed as though SarCraft might finally know tranquility.

How wrong they were.

## Pre-Season Events

### The End of Season 2

Season 2 came to an abrupt end on April 6, 2020, when SarCraft lost its world file. Just days later, on April 9, the Season 2 group chat was nuked for unknown reasons, resulting in the permanent loss of chat logs from Seasons 0-2. These technical catastrophes set the stage for what would become one of the most chaotic seasons in SarCraft history.

## Season Start

Season 3 officially began on April 10, 2020, with the creation of a new group chat. [[shihaam_me]] laid down the law: hacks were officially banned, and a new world would be generated. The server would support both Java 1.15.2 and Bedrock 1.14 clients to accommodate more players.

### The Skin War

The very day of the server's creation, tensions emerged between premium and non-premium Minecraft users. Premium players advocated for the server to be online so their skins would be visible, while "cracked" users—unable to afford premium accounts—argued against this requirement. This divided the player base before a single block had been placed.

### The Day One Catastrophe

In what would become known as the first great "Sar Moment" of the new age, disaster struck merely 24 hours after the season's launch. In an incident that would become synonymous with administrative incompetence, [[shihaam_me]] accidentally deleted the entire server world. Players who had spent the previous day establishing their first bases and gathering resources watched in horror as their progress vanished in an instant.

This catastrophic error set the tone for what would become one of the shortest, yet most turbulent seasons in SarCraft history.

## Early Season Developments

### The Iron Incident

The tensions of [[Season 2]] had not been forgotten. As players scrambled to rebuild after the reset, a chance encounter near spawn would ignite the first conflict of the new era. [[Redacted]], still bitter from the revolution that had deposed him, stumbled upon a vulnerable [[shihaam_me]] attempting to leave spawn.

What followed was swift and merciless.

Without hesitation, [[Redacted]] struck down the administrator, pilfering his iron ingots before fleeing into the wilderness. This act of aggression, which would later become known as the "Just Iron Incident," planted the seeds of resentment that would ultimately doom the season.

The aftermath was immediate and contentious. [[shihaam_me]] wanted to ban [[Redacted]] over the theft, while [[Anoojfunaid]] expressed regret for inviting [[ToadGod]] to the server, as ToadGod opposed the ban.

### Class in Economics

One of the most divisive early discussions centered around [[ToadGod]]'s suggestion to use diamonds as the server's official currency. This seemingly innocuous proposal split the server into two camps, with heated debates erupting in the group chat. During these discussions, players were shocked to discover that [[ToadGod]] believed that popular SMP (Survival Multiplayer) series on YouTube were not scripted.

### New Server Rules

By April 13, the growing tensions necessitated the establishment of formal server rules:

- Just play peacefully
- Don't do unwanted PvP
- Don't start war unless both parties want it
- Trade with whatever you like
- Don't attack villagers
- Don't kill someone else's farm animals, loot them
- Don't mock Islam! Anyone who attempts will be banned

### Spawn Disagreement

Meanwhile, chaos erupted among the [[Spawn Mason]]s. What began as a practical security concern escalated into a full-scale factional split. [[Nausham]] and [[Anoojfunaid|GurdhaanRamzee]] argued passionately that establishing bases too close to spawn posed an unacceptable risk – any new players joining the server could easily locate and raid their precious stockpiles. Despite the [[Spawn Mason]]s' ideals of community and cooperation, the fear of theft proved too compelling to ignore.

The disagreement grew heated. Unable to convince their fellow Masons of the danger, [[Nausham]] and [[Anoojfunaid|GurdhaanRamzee]] made the fateful decision to abandon spawn entirely. In this moment of division, they sensed an opportunity and joined forces with [[Redacted]], effectively resurrecting the infamous [[Nazi]] faction that had terrorized previous seasons.

The old powers were returning, and with them, the old conflicts.

## Technical Issues

### Inventory Bug

An alarming bug emerged where players' inventories would be completely wiped upon logging out of the server. This technical issue added another layer of instability to an already chaotic season.

### Login Exploit

On April 14, the [[Nazi]] faction discovered an exploit in the login plugin that allowed players to avoid taking damage entirely. This game-breaking vulnerability gave them a significant advantage in potential conflicts and further undermined the server's precarious balance.

## Major Events

### Operation Search And Rescue

Not long after establishing their renewed faction, disaster struck the [[Nazi]] leadership. [[Redacted]] found himself trapped deep within a cave system, without tools and with dwindling food supplies. Death by starvation seemed imminent.

In response, [[Nausham]] and [[Anoojfunaid|GurdhaanRamzee]] mounted what would become known as "Operation Search and Rescue" – a desperate mission to extract their leader from the depths. What they lacked in preparation, they made up for in determination.

Sadly, determination alone cannot mine stone.

The rescue attempt ended in catastrophic failure, with all three players perishing in the darkness. The valuable ores they had mined were lost, scattered among the stone corridors where their bodies had fallen. The operation would go down in SarCraft lore as one of the most disastrous rescue missions ever attempted.

### DUPES DUPES DUPES

On April 13, the [[Nazi]] faction stumbled upon something that would alter the very fabric of SarCraft's economy – a powerful duplication glitch. This exploit allowed them to create hundreds of identical items in moments, a secret weapon that could grant them unlimited resources.

A new objective emerged – find rare items worth duplicating. The search for Enchanted Golden Apples began, these legendary items being the ultimate prize for their duplication scheme.

### The Egg Heist

Undeterred by their recent failures, the [[Nazi]] faction devised a strategy that would secure their dominance for the remainder of the season. Using the server seed, they located the closest End portal to spawn and embarked on a treacherous journey – "The Great Migration."

#### The Great Migration

Their plan was as devious as it was effective. [[ToadGod]], in an attempt to prevent the griefing that had plagued previous seasons, had implemented a new rule prohibiting players from entering other bases without permission. The [[Nazi]] faction intended to exploit this rule by claiming the End portal as part of their base, effectively controlling access to the End dimension and its valuable resources.

![[migration.jpg]]
*Across treacherous terrain they traveled, establishing their new headquarters around the strategic stronghold. Little did they know, fate had other plans.*

#### The Great Sike of Toad

As the [[Nazi]] faction settled into their new stronghold, disturbing news reached them through the server chat. [[ToadGod]] had announced his intention to raid the End dimension and distribute Elytra wings to all players – a direct threat to the [[Nazi]] monopoly plan.

Time was running out. The race for the End had begun.

In a twist of cosmic irony, as [[ToadGod]] traveled through the Nether, his newly created portal inexplicably linked with the [[Nazi]] base portal – a one-in-a-million coincidence that revealed their secret location.

![[toad_finds_nazi_hideout.jpg]]

Realizing their advantage was slipping away, the [[Nazi]] faction made a bold decision. They would raid the End immediately, claim the Dragon Egg, and secure their place in SarCraft history before [[ToadGod]] could interfere.

On April 14, the [[Nazi]] faction successfully raided the End and claimed the coveted Dragon Egg. When [[ToadGod]] arrived at the End two days later, he discovered the egg was gone, further intensifying the faction rivalry.

### The "Farming = Hacking" Debate

On April 16, a philosophical conflict emerged when [[Anoojfunaid]] argued that building an iron farm violated the game's intended economy and was equivalent to hacking. [[ToadGod]] vehemently disagreed, leading to a lengthy and heated debate about the ethics of automated farms in Minecraft.

### The Expensive Donkey Incident

In one of the most tragicomic moments of Season 3, [[Anoojfunaid|GurdhaanRamzee]] successfully located an Enchanted Golden Apple – only to accidentally feed it to the very donkey they were using for duplication.

![[expensive donkey.jpg]]

This catastrophic error led to an extreme decision. The [[Nazi]] faction destroyed their own base, eliminating all evidence of their presence, and embarked on a second migration to establish a new, secure location for their duplication operations.

![[migration2.jpg]]

However, on April 19, [[Anoojfunaid]] found another enchanted golden apple, partially redeeming the faction after the donkey blunder.

### Tower to Heaven

What followed was perhaps the most bizarrely over-engineered construction in SarCraft history. To transport their horses and duplication donkeys to their new location, the [[Nazi]] faction constructed a wooden tower that stretched to the build limit – "The Tower to Heaven."

![[tower to heavin.jpg]]

At the summit, a Nether portal awaited, designed to transport their animals without the risk of portal linking issues that had exposed their previous base. Once the animals had been safely transported, the entire wooden structure was set ablaze, eliminating any evidence of their passage.

>the [[Nazi]]'s are not really known for their logical thinking. just their random, expensive and over engineered buildings and this would be one of those 
>the same thing can be achieved by building the portal on the roof and sending the horses through it and breaking the portal

![[tower to heavin burning.jpg]]
*the tower is burned once the horses are sent as to erase any evidence of a portal being built there*

### Sky Island 

Their final destination was a small obsidian platform constructed high above an ocean – "Sky Island." This remote location, far from the prying eyes of other players, became the center of their duplication operation.

![[sky island.jpg]]

From this seemingly insignificant platform, the [[Nazi]] faction amassed wealth beyond imagination, all while the rest of the server remained oblivious to the exploit they had discovered.

## COVID-19 Impacts

### Lockdown Extended

On April 15, 2020, at 10:13 AM, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Male'. This real-world event significantly impacted server activity as players found themselves with more time to play during quarantine.

> [!NOTE] Official HPA Announcement
> The Health Protection Agency (HPA) announced the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Male' through an official tweet: [https://twitter.com/HPA_MV/status/1250291208930201602](https://twitter.com/HPA_MV/status/1250291208930201602)

### 24-Hour Full Lockdown

Just hours after [[Anoojfunaid]]'s wedding preparations were being finalized on April 15, a 24-hour full lockdown was announced in Male' at 14:32. This lockdown would have major implications for player availability and activity patterns in the days that followed.

> [!NOTE] Full Lockdown Announcement
> The 24-hour full lockdown was officially announced through the HPA's Twitter account: [https://twitter.com/HPA_MV/status/1250291208930201602](https://twitter.com/HPA_MV/status/1250291208930201602)

## Social Events

### Anooj's Wedding

On April 14, the first-ever documented attempt at an [[Anoojfunaid]] wedding was planned on the server. Preparations continued until April 15, but the wedding was ultimately cancelled when the bride updated her Minecraft version, making her incompatible with the server's Bedrock plugin.

This would become the first of many failed wedding attempts for [[Anoojfunaid]] across multiple seasons.

### Pirate Language Pack

On April 19, in a moment of levity amidst the chaos, the server discovered that Minecraft had a pirate language pack. This brief cultural phenomenon provided some comic relief during the increasingly tense season.

## The Final Days

### Wither on the Loose

On April 24, the [[Nazi]] faction attempted to kill a Wither but lost control of it, allowing the destructive boss mob to roam freely on the server. This unintentional act of server-wide chaos would be among the final events of the season.

### The Diamond Penis Incident

The [[Nazi]] faction's duplication operation had only one missing component – a Beacon. The only player known to possess one was their rival, [[ToadGod]], who predictably refused to share it with them.

In response, the faction devised a plan that exemplified their peculiar approach to diplomacy. In the dead of night, while the [[Spawn Mason]]s slept, they constructed an enormous diamond Penis directly in front of [[ToadGod]]'s base.
![[penis.jpg]]
>once again the [[Nazi]]'s are not known for their practicality when it comes to builds.

the next morning a fight breaks out in the server group chat due to the structure

##### Pissing contest
When morning came and the monument was discovered, chaos erupted in the server chat. What followed was a dispute so legendary it would be remembered as "The Pissing Contest" – a heated debate over land claims, griefing rules, and the architectural merit of diamond genitalia.
![[penis map.jpg]]
![[view from toad spawn base.jpg]]

[[ToadGod]] claims that the build counts as griefing 
[[Nazi]]'s claim its a building they made at spawn as a pitstop since they fly to spawn a lot 
[[ToadGod]] claims that [[Nazi]]'s has no claim to the land the penis was built on
[[Nazi]]'s claims that everyone has claim to spawn and its their spot on spawn as they cleared out an unclaimed forest area to build it 
[[Nazi]]'s claim the beacon they installed in the penis will be of great contribution to the [[Spawn Mason]]

[[CatMDV]] is quoted saying 
> If it was a dick made out of obs, im not interested

[[Redacted]] claims ownership of the island the penis is on 
[[ToadGod]] is against it as he doesn't wanna look at a diamond penis 
[[ToadGod]] tries to take down the penis
[[Nazi]] claim that would count as griefing as they own the island and the penis

The dispute escalated to such levels that it required official intervention. [[shihaam_me]] presided as judge in what would become the first formal trial in SarCraft history.

The proceedings were chaotic. [[CatMDV]] abandoned the trial, refusing to "entertain kids arguing over a penis in Minecraft." [[ToadGod]] repeatedly interrupted the judge, speaking out of turn and further inflaming tensions.

the judge comes to a verdict 

>This action do not count as grieing
>However
>Believe a dick is structure do not count SFW
>[[Nazi]] Take it down and you may continue to build in that island as long as it do not disturb [[Spawn Mason]]
>[[Spawn Mason]] state your terms allowing them to build in that island that won't disturb you

the players are now allowed to speak

[[ToadGod]] responds to the judge
>I can't grant permission for them to build there. It's next to my base literally. That is also where a path is going to be to connect my base to the village.. 
>We agreed to not meddle, build or build near each other's bases at the start of the season. Not even a month and they already started being toxic again. Heevanee bureega kashi jahaigen ulheyhen. "Oh shit I can't stop being toxic and a nuisance to others omg 😨😨😨😨"
>My request is that they build in their village and near their village. This is ridiculous.

[[Redacted]] responds
>i don't think we need his perms to build on the land just because its within the render distance of his base
>we scouted the area to build and most places were full of creeper holes and it was unsafe to build so we settled on the island 
>we cleared out the land and flattened it i believe we should be able to keep the land we worked on 
>as far as the toxic claims i think we have been civil through out the hearing and not called anyone names
>i was not aware of the no nsfw rule since i agreed to the ones on tele
>but now that i have been notified that discord rules are the ones enforced
>we agree to take down the penis and follow the discord rules

[[Anoojfunaid|GurdhaanRamzee]] responds
>First of all, the land had no claim on it, there were only naturally generated stuff in the area, trees and dirt hills. We took them down ourselves, we cleared the area out ourselves. We made sure they didn't have any claim on the land before we built it. I'm in the middle of taking down the penis since it goes against the rules. I've already built a wall made of diamonds showing that this is the piece of land that we want and I think it's a reasonable chunk of land. Had they atleast lit up the place we would've left it alone. But they didn't. If they lay claim to the land and wanted to build in it later, they should've laid claim to it by atleast lighting it up, which they haven't. So I think we have full freedom to build whatever we want over there as long as it follows the rules of the game. 
>I believe we've been civil in this conversation. We haven't gone around calling each other names and I would very much appreciate it if no one else does it to us also.

the judge concludes the hearing with the verdict, and the [[Nazi]] faction peacefully removes the penis structure.

### The Price of Iron

As the dispute raged on, [[shihaam_me]]'s patience reached its breaking point. In a sudden and shocking announcement, he declared [[Redacted]] banned from the server. The administrator cited the "Just Iron" incident from the season's beginning as the final straw, but everyone knew the true reason – he was simply fed up with the constant arguments and complaints.

The server erupted into chaos. The two factions began hurling accusations at one another, each blaming the other for the ban and the season's collapse.

And then, without warning or ceremony, the server shut down.

Season 3 had lasted just thirteen days – the shortest season in SarCraft history.

From administrative incompetence to factional warfare, from accidental world deletion to diamond phalluses, Season 3 packed more drama into two weeks than most servers see in a year. It stands as a testament to SarCraft's unique ability to generate chaos, even in the most controlled of environments.

The server would go quiet for a time, but as always in SarCraft history, this was merely the calm before the storm. The Middle Ages had ended, and players could only wonder what new era of madness awaited them when the server inevitably returned.
