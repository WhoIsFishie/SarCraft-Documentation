Code_Name : The Start

not much is known about season 0 as there was very little documentation about this period in Sarcraft history. speaking to past players its noted that [[shihaam_me]] created the server to play minecraft with a girl he liked. [[Redacted]] was the second player to join the server to keep the server active 

the first days on the server was peaceful until [[shihaam_me]] commits a major sin 

#### First court case
a few weeks into the server we encounter the first of many server court cases.
the case of the [[Cow Ziney]]

the judge for the court session was The Fat Lady
[[Redacted]] accused [[shihaam_me]] of breeding his([[Redacted]]) cow with another cow. this was seen as a great sin 

who won the court case is not documented


#### End of season 0
the season finally comes to an end with [[shihaam_me]] killing [[Redacted]] by going into creative and throwing a potion of harming on [[Redacted]] 

its unknown if the girl the server was made for ever joined or not
