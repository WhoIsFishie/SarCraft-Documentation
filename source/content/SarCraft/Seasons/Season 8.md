# Season 8: The Reign of Fish Bundy

In the long and infamous history of SarCraft, certain eras stand as monuments to the depths of player depravity and cunning. Among these dark chapters, none casts a longer shadow than Season 8 - a period that would come to be known simply as "The Reign of Fish Bundy."

## The Birth of a Monster

What appeared to be a peaceful mini-season, with players quietly building and exploring, harbored a sinister undercurrent. [[WhoIsFishie]], perhaps the most notorious player in server history, had undergone a disturbing transformation. Adopting the persona of "Fish Bundy" - an homage to one of history's most infamous serial killers - he made a blood oath to himself: at least one player would die by his hand each episode.

This wasn't mere PvP combat or factional warfare. This was calculated, methodical hunting of the server's inhabitants.

Season 8 is a short mini season with players mostly chilling and doing their own thing 

## The First Victim

It didn't take long for Fish Bundy to claim his first victim. Finding [[shihaam_me]] - the server's admin and creator - AFK and vulnerable, [[WhoIsFishie]] executed a meticulously planned murder. Not content with a simple sword strike, he constructed an simple suffocation contraption around the unsuspecting admin. When [[shihaam_me]] returned to his keyboard, he found himself gasping for air, trapped in a claustrophobic prison of blocks with his oxygen depleting rapidly.

The server death message appeared: [[shihaam_me]] suffocated to death.

Fish Bundy had drawn first blood, and the hunt had only just begun.

## The Weaponization of Exploits

What truly set [[WhoIsFishie]] apart wasn't simply his bloodlust, but his technological innovation in the pursuit of murder. Through exhaustive testing and experimentation, he had discovered a way to reliably trigger what players called the "Identity Theft" bug - a critical flaw in the server's authentication system.

This exploit was nothing short of terrifying. It allowed [[WhoIsFishie]] to effectively teleport unsuspecting players to any location of his choosing. And he had set his sights on his next target: [[iBattus]].

After seasons of rivalry, after countless combat-logs where [[iBattus]] had escaped death at the last moment, [[WhoIsFishie]] had found the ultimate weapon. Using the exploit, he forcibly teleported [[iBattus]] into the domain of one of Minecraft's most fearsome mobs - the Warden.

In the pitch-black caverns of the Deep Dark, [[iBattus]] materialized in confusion. Before he could process what had happened, the ground trembled. Sensors activated. The Warden emerged from the ground, its massive form homing in on [[iBattus]]'s position with supernatural accuracy.

The server message appeared: [[iBattus]] was slain by Warden.

But [[WhoIsFishie]] wasn't satisfied with this indirect kill. Taking advantage of [[iBattus]]'s confusion and vulnerability, he teleported him once more to the same location and delivered the killing blow personally. The server message that followed was what[[WhoIsFishie]] had been waiting for across multiple seasons:

[[iBattus]] was slain by [[WhoIsFishie]].

After multiple seasons of combat logging and narrow escapes, the unthinkable had happened. [[iBattus]] had finally fallen not once but twice - first to the Warden and then to [[WhoIsFishie]] himself. His celebration echoed through the server chat as he finally claimed his long-sought prize.

## The Trial of the Century

What followed would go down in SarCraft lore as "The Fish Bundy Trials" - perhaps the most absurd legal proceeding in digital history.

In an unprecedented twist, [[iBattus]] denied being killed by [[WhoIsFishie]] at all, claiming the death didn't count since it was the Warden that had dealt the final blow. This led to the formation of a formal court case titled "Who Actually Killed [[iBattus]]," with [[athphane]] presiding as judge.

The legal teams assembled:

- [[shihaam_me]] representing [[iBattus]] as defense attorney
- [[TheHarryG]] serving as [[WhoIsFishie]]'s prosecutor

The courtroom was packed with spectators, including [[invisble715]] and [[CatMDV]], who attended merely to witness the proceedings. [[CatMDV]] was even noted to have fallen asleep during parts of the trial, evidence of just how drawn-out the legal proceedings became.

The star witness of the trial was, most bizarrely, the Warden itself, with [[Buhkiru]] serving as translator for the blind creature.

In his video statement, [[WhoIsFishie]] was quoted saying:

> "People started accusing me of not killing him and that the kill doesn't count, so now I have to go to court and prove that I did indeed murder him. Can you believe I am being accused of not murdering someone? That is absolutely horrendous, and I will not stand for such sort of discrimination. That is not what this Minecraft server is about."

During the trial, [[TheHarryG]] called the Warden to the stand, with [[Buhkiru]] acting as court-appointed translator. A bizarre image was captured of the Warden standing under oath:

When questioned if [[WhoIsFishie]] had used the Warden as a tool, the Warden confirmed this through its translator.

[[TheHarryG]] summarized his case with passion:

> "My client abused the Warden, used the Warden for his own devices and for his own personal goal. If that doesn't make him guilty, then I don't know what does. So please, your honor, please sentence this man to be guilty and let him have his bragging rights!"

When [[iBattus]] took the stand, [[TheHarryG]] launched into his questioning:

[[TheHarryG]]: "How many times were you killed?"    
[[iBattus]]: "0."    
[[shihaam_me]]: "That's not true."

Caught in this contradiction, [[iBattus]] then claimed he couldn't be asked that question because it infringed upon his rights. When pressed further about how many times he had died on the server, [[iBattus]] first admitted the Warden killed him but denied [[WhoIsFishie]]'s involvement.

In a stunning turn, [[Buhkiru]] presented conclusive evidence: a screenshot showing the death message clearly stating that [[WhoIsFishie]] had killed [[iBattus]].

[[shihaam_me]] attempted a last-ditch defense, claiming that while [[WhoIsFishie]] might have technically killed [[iBattus]], the fact that [[iBattus]] was defenseless meant that [[WhoIsFishie]] deserved no bragging rights for the kill.

## Judgment and Chaos

After hearing all testimony, Judge [[athphane]] delivered his verdict:

> "I think I have other information I need after, uh, two second thought on this matter. On the first count of the Warden killing [[iBattus]], [[WhoIsFishie]] gets no Bragging Rights and I also acknowledge that [[WhoIsFishie]] did not kill [[iBattus]] on the first count. In the second count of [[WhoIsFishie]] killing [[iBattus]] while he had nothing to protect him, [[WhoIsFishie]] is a murderer. I sentence [[WhoIsFishie]] to drowning, immediately!"

With these words, all semblance of order and civility evaporated. The courtroom erupted into absolute chaos:

- [[TheHarryG]] slew the judge in protest
- [[WhoIsFishie]] executed [[shihaam_me]] on the spot
- [[TheHarryG]] killed the judge a second time for good measure
- [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Buhkiru]] launched a coordinated attack on [[invisble715]]
- [[shihaam_me]] attempted to retaliate against [[WhoIsFishie]] with seeds (yes, seeds) and was promptly slaughtered
- [[Buhkiru]] finished off [[invisble715]]
- [[WhoIsFishie]], in a rare show of mercy, spared [[CatMDV]], who had been peacefully observing
- [[TheHarryG]], unaware of Cat's neutrality, killed him anyway

What had begun as a trial to determine the validity of a Minecraft kill had descended into a bloodbath that rivaled any faction war in server history. [[CatMDV]] was seen watching [[shihaam_me]] die before [[TheHarryG]] claimed him as the final victim of the courtroom massacre.

The server would shortly die after this incident, bringing an abrupt end to Season 8 itself. Players drifted away, perhaps disturbed by the darkness they had witnessed or simply bored now that the server's most compelling drama had reached its conclusion.

## End of FishBundy

[[WhoIsFishie]] would later remark that he felt like "Joker without Batman" - having finally succeeded in killing his nemesis [[iBattus]] after multiple seasons of trying, he found himself without purpose, adrift in a world without worthy adversaries.
