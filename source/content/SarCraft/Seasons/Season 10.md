#### February 5th - A new start
[[shihaam_me]] activates the group chat with a hello and forwards polls for suggested changes to the new season. these changes included the following

[^1] Poll votes and its results
- Disable all villager trading [53:47]
 - Disable diamond ore spawning [60:40]
 - Disable Mending book [44:56]
 - World size 10k [73:27]
 - Disable Ender Chest [50:50]
 - Proximity voice Mod [80:20]

#### February 11th - Cracks in the wall
[[WhoIsFishie]] suggests a more seamless auth plugin which [[iBattus]] and [[shihaam_me]] rejects. 
after very little discussion [[shihaam_me]] is quoted saying
> Who cares about what [[WhoIsFishie]] wants  

which leads [[WhoIsFishie]] to make a poll to find out who cares about what [[WhoIsFishie]] wants

upon realizing that the poll was going in [[WhoIsFishie]]'s favor [[shihaam_me]] deletes all history of the chat involving the auth plugin discussion 

[[shihaam_me]] later explains to  [[WhoIsFishie]] the reason he's against seamless login for premium players is because Microsoft deleted his account for refusing to migrate. so now everyone must use the gay telegram auth instead.

#### February 12th - Short Peace
[[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]] continues to argue about auth plugin leading to an end to the truce agreement 

![[Pasted image 20250212141730.png]]

[^1]: the results are included in the following format [yes:no]


#### February 22th - Peace is back
a telegram call takes place between players where the following players join
- [[iBattus]]
- [[WhoIsFishie]]
- [[shihaam_me]]
- [[Anoojfunaid]]
- [[Buhkiru]]
- [[athphane]]

during this call [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] would try to convice [[athphane]] to join the side of ditching the telegram based auth plugin which is respoinsbile for [[Exploits#Identity Theft]]

after alot of talks [[iBattus]] and [[shihaam_me]] would agree to switch to EasyAuth and [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] and [[iBattus]] would return back to a state of peace 


## Mods and changes
Season 10 started with alot of pre planning due to collaboration from [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]]   
### No eyes
for starters the crafting of ender eyes are disabled. this was a mod written to prevent anyone from going into the end. but in reality its because [[WhoIsFishie]] didn't know how to code of a proper way to disable the end    
this had an unintended consequence as now ender chests are also disabled. luckily for the players the new jungle temple structures would spawn in with an ender chest in the treasure room. making ender chests a rare item 
### No Diamonds
a mod was written to replace all diamond ores so that players cant mine for diamonds anymore. this is to slow down the progression of players.
### No Nether
Nether is disabled for 2 weeks. a mod was written to prevent players from lighting portals but players can just use a fire charge to light it or lightning or just a burning log. [[WhoIsFishie]] only disabled flint and steel from lighting the portal. to make up for this flaw in logic a new change was made to kill anyone who touches the portal. 
### Balancing updates
with diamonds removed some changes had to be made to balance out the game  
- villager trading was completely removed all together so that players cant buy diamond tools or mending books 
- Anvil Updates : to make up for removing mending anvils will no longer refuse to repair tools. price would also not increase to absurd levels
### Graves mod
to fix items despawning  a graves mod was added. other players are able to loot graves as well. graves would only store 10% of a players xp. 
### Pet mods
#### Chested Companions
this is a mod that allows you to put a chest on dogs which offers 9 slots   
when a dog is killed it would drop all the items stored. these items are not saved by the grave mod
#### Sleeping dogs
changes to dog animation where dogs would go to sleep after sitting for too long
#### Fat cats
a resource pack which would make cats chonky
#### Better horses
a mod to make horses better
