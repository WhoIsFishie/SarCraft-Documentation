#### February 5th - A new start
[[shihaam_me]] activates the group chat with a hello and forwards polls for suggested changes to the new season. these changes included the following

[^1] Poll votes and its results
- Disable all villager trading [53:47]
 - Disable diamond ore spawning [60:40]
 - Disable Mending book [44:56]
 - World size 10k [73:27]
 - Disable Ender Chest [50:50]

#### February 11th - Cracks in the wall
[[WhoIsFishie]] suggests a more seamless auth plugin which [[iBattus]] and [[shihaam_me]] rejects. 
after very little discussion [[shihaam_me]] is quoted saying
> Who cares about what [[WhoIsFishie]] wants  

which leads [[WhoIsFishie]] to make a poll to find out who cares about what [[WhoIsFishie]] wants

upon realizing that the poll was going in [[WhoIsFishie]]'s favor [[shihaam_me]] deletes all history of the chat involving the auth plugin discussion 

[[shihaam_me]] later explains to  [[WhoIsFishie]] the reason he's against seamless login for premium players is because Microsoft deleted his account for refusing to migrate. so now everyone must use the gay telegram auth instead.

#### February 12th - Short Peace
[[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]] continues to argue about auth plugin leading to an end to the truce agreement
