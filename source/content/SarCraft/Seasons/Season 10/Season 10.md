In the continuing saga of SarCraft history, Season 10 stands as a testament to both reconciliation and innovation. Before the season's launch, a significant amount of behind-the-scenes preparation took place, including a momentous peace agreement between longtime rivals [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]]. To prevent the infamous "2 week Minecraft phase" that had plagued previous seasons, gameplay changes were implemented to artificially slow player progression. [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]], in collaboration with [[iBattus]], developed mods that would fundamentally alter gameplay mechanics.

## Pre-Launch Developments

### February 4th - The White Flag

After seasons of bitter rivalry, [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]] reached a historic peace agreement, signaling a new era for the server. ![[fishie_ibattus_peace_agreement_chatlog.png]]

### February 5th - Charting a New Course

[[shihaam_me]] reactivated the group chat and initiated polls for changes to the new season. The proposed modifications included:

- Disable all villager trading [53:47]
- Disable diamond ore spawning [60:40]
- Disable Mending book [44:56]
- World size 10k [73:27]
- Disable Ender Chest [50:50]
- Proximity voice Mod [80:20]

### February 11th - Cracks in the Foundation

Tensions emerged when [[WhoIsFishie]] suggested a more seamless authentication plugin, which [[iBattus]] and [[shihaam_me]] rejected. The situation escalated when [[shihaam_me]] was quoted saying:

> Who cares about what [[WhoIsFishie]] wants

In response, [[WhoIsFishie]] created a poll to determine who actually cared about his input. ![[who cares what fishie wants poll results.png]]

Upon seeing the poll results favoring [[WhoIsFishie]], [[shihaam_me]] deleted all chat history related to the authentication plugin discussion. He later explained his opposition to seamless login was due to Microsoft deleting his account when he refused to migrate.

### February 12th - Broken Peace

The debate over authentication plugins continued, leading to the collapse of the truce between [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]]. ![[fishie vs ibattus over auth plugin chat log.png]]

### February 22nd - Reconciliation

A pivotal Telegram call took place with key players:

- [[iBattus]]
- [[WhoIsFishie]]
- [[shihaam_me]]
- [[Anoojfunaid]]
- [[Buhkiru]]
- [[athphane]]
- [[FlameXode]]


During this discussion, [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] attempted to convince [[athphane]] to support abandoning the Telegram-based authentication plugin responsible for the [[Exploits#Identity Theft]] vulnerability. After extensive negotiations, [[iBattus]] and [[shihaam_me]] agreed to switch to EasyAuth, and the peace between [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] and [[iBattus]] was restored.

[[iBattus]] would also return as an admin for this season

## Week 1

### ToadGod's Quiet Return as ToadBlaze 

Season 10 witnessed the unexpected return of [[ToadGod]], a legendary figure from SarCraft's early history who hadn't been seen since the collapse of Season 3. His arrival under a new username `ToadBlaze` was notable primarily in the server logs rather than in the gameworld itself, with only veteran players recognizing the connection to the influential ToadGod of old. 

Unlike the revolutionary firebrand who once led server-wide votes and championed the [[Spawn Mason]]'s community ideals, ToadBlaze chose to keep a low profile in Season 10. Most current players knew neither his former nor current persona, recognizing his name only through server chronicles and old chat logs, if at all. 

The man who once deposed the [[Nazi]] leadership and inadvertently triggered the "Diamond Penis Incident" that ended Season 3 now kept largely to himself, avoiding the factional politics and server-wide drama that had become SarCraft's hallmark in his absence. Whether this reflected a change in his approach or simply caution in a server landscape that had evolved dramatically during his seven-season absence remained to be seen.
### The Four Corners Expedition

In a daring display of early-game exploration, [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Donut]] accomplished the seemingly impossible: visiting all four world borders in just three days. Supported by [[Chicken Factory]] members [[Klen04]] and [[Buhkiru]], the duo set out with carefully prepared diamond gear and a strategic plan.

#### The Journey

- **Day 1**: Extensive resource gathering and preparation
- **Day 2**:
    - Reached Northern Border (z:-10000)
    - Marked with a sign (accidentally misdated as "20-March")
    - Proceeded to Eastern Border (x:10000)
- **Day 3**:
    - Conquered Western Border (x:-10000)
    - Reached Southern Border (z:10000)
    - Brought along dogs with storage chests, leading to comical rescue missions

#### Challenges

The expedition wasn't without its hurdles. Wandering dogs, treacherous terrain, and the sheer scale of the journey tested the explorers' resolve. Yet, [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Donut]] persevered, successfully mapping over 80,000 blocks of terrain.

### The Chicken Factory Infighting

A tense chapter in SarCraft history unfolded when [[Perhaps]] crafted a legendary weapon - a god sword named after the infamous blade [[Anoojfunaid]] used to slay [[Ssahan]] during the brutal conflicts of [[Season 9]].

What began as a simple naming ceremony spiraled into chaos when [[Nausham]], seeing an opportunity for mischief, attempted to kill [[Anoojfunaid]] with the very sword named in his honor, hoping the server would announce the weapon's prestigious name in the death message.

Alert to the danger, [[Anoojfunaid]] quickly mounted his trusted steed Michelangelo, triggering a frantic chase across the landscape. For four intense minutes, hunter and hunted weaved through the terrain until [[Perhaps]] dramatically intervened - slaying both Michelangelo and [[Anoojfunaid]] in a shocking betrayal.

Fueled by rage and seeking revenge, [[Anoojfunaid]] commandeered [[Buhkiru]]'s prized horse Juan and fled into the wilderness. His escape was short-lived, however, as he accidentally rode into a deep ravine, resulting in the tragic deaths of both himself and the innocent Juan.

The server exploded with outrage at this series of misfortunes. Players mobilized against [[Anoojfunaid]], who responded by slaying Adhuray the endermite - a beloved server pet. This final act of defiance crossed an unspoken line, uniting the entire server in condemnation.

As players closed in for vengeance, someone suggested a more civilized approach - a formal trial for [[Anoojfunaid]]'s crimes. Desperate for representation, [[Anoojfunaid]] approached [[Donut]] to serve as his legal counsel, only to be rebuffed when she declared her allegiance to the fallen Adhuray.

In a last attempt, [[Anoojfunaid]] turned to [[Perhaps]] for legal representation, who took offense at not being the first choice for counsel. Surrounded by enemies and abandoned by potential allies, [[Anoojfunaid]] rage-quit the server, vowing never to return - adding his name to the long list of players whose SarCraft careers ended in infamous glory.



### Server Backdoor
on day 4 of the server members of [[Chicken Factory]] were bored and decided to mess with the Telegram plugin on the server. this is the same plugin written by [[Udit]] 

[[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Buhkiru]] would keep on trying different injection methods to see if they can inject commands

after a while they would get bored of it but [[FlameXode]] took notice of this 

### Race To Ender Chest
with ender eyes disabled chicken factory had to get creative with how they were gonna obtain ender chests to store their loot

[[WhoIsFishie]] checks over the [Dungeons and Taverns]([Dungeons and Taverns - Minecraft Data Pack](https://modrinth.com/datapack/dungeons-and-taverns))  structures to find that ender chests would spawn inside ruined jungle temple structures 

![[echest_in_temple.jpg]]

as soon as the [[Chicken Factory]] was made aware of this news players would split into 4 corners of the world to locate the rare ender chests. before heading out [[Buhkiru]] would give all players a silk touch pickaxe 

- [[Perhaps]] would locate the first ender chest on the south west corner of the map 
- [[Buhkiru]] would locate the second ender chest on the northern side of the map that [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] barely missed on his trip to the northern border

with the ender chest secured [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] would ask [[Ssahan]] to come to spawn so that he can go and flex on him

things would go bad as [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] also had purple concrete in his hotbar which [[Ssahan]] would see as [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] was scrolling through his inventory and incorrectly assume its a shulker box 

### Day of the exploit

day 5

[[WhoIsFishie]] would go live on tiktok streaming SarCraft and [[FlameXode]] would join the chat to ask if she exploit worked. [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] would say it didnt and [[FlameXode]] would then demonstrate the correct way to do the exploit. turns out [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] only did one of the 2 steps needed to trigger the command

as soon as [[FlameXode]] replied to his own command msg it gave everyone on the server 2 shulker shells

Players active at the time of exploit
- [[Ssahan]]
- [[WhoIsFishie]]
- [[iBattus]]
- [[yeetuz]]

[[WhoIsFishie]] would burn his shells on live as the items are considered illegal. its unclear what the other users did with their shells

with a exploit being widely known and [[Ssahan]] suspecting [[WhoIsFishie]]. [[iBattus]] finally had enough cause to go after [[WhoIsFishie]].

[[iBattus]] would use admin powers to check [[WhoIsFishie]]'s ender chest

![[fishie_echest.jpg]]

this would get posted in the SarCraft group chat as evidence of [[WhoIsFishie]] cheating. 

[[WhoIsFishie]] would accuse [[iBattus]] of framing him by placing the shulker box there as he dont want to admit that [[Ssahan]] was wrong 

[[WhoIsFishie]] is also said if he owned a shulker box it would be red.  [[shihaam_me]] would agree with this statement knowing that [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] loves the color red

[[WhoIsFishie]] would also accuse [[iBattus]] of admin abuse as he checked [[WhoIsFishie]]'s ender chest without a court order

ultimately nothing would happen and everyone would clown on [[iBattus]]. the server would then disable Minecraft msgs being shown in the telegram group chat as to prevent users from using the [[Exploits#Telegram Command Injection]]. 

later that night server would go down as [[FlameXode]] tried to push an update to patch out the exploit
