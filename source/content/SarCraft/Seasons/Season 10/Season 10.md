![[Seasons/S10_images/minecraft_title.png]]


In the continuing saga of SarCraft history, Season 10 stands as a testament to both reconciliation and innovation. Before the season's launch, a significant amount of behind-the-scenes preparation took place, including a momentous peace agreement between longtime rivals [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]]. To prevent the infamous "2 week Minecraft phase" that had plagued previous seasons, gameplay changes were implemented to artificially slow player progression. [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]], in collaboration with [[iBattus]], developed mods that would fundamentally alter gameplay mechanics.

## Pre-Launch Developments

### February 4th - The White Flag

On February 4th, 2025, the unthinkable happened. After years of bitter rivalry spanning multiple seasons, [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]] – the server's most legendary antagonists – reached out across enemy lines to negotiate peace.

The server was stunned. Veterans who had witnessed the [[Season 5|Age of Revolution]], the [[Season 8|Fish Bundy Trials]], and the [[Season 9|Great War]] could scarcely believe these mortal enemies had finally buried the hatchet. The white flag had been raised, and for a brief, shining moment, peace seemed possible.

![[fishie_ibattus_peace_agreement_chatlog.png]]

### February 5th - The Modded Revolution

With the historic peace agreement signed, attention turned to Season 10's ambitious technical overhaul. For the first time in server history, [[shihaam_me]] activated a suite of game-changing mods designed by the unlikely partnership of [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]].

The most controversial changes struck at the very heart of Minecraft progression:

- **Diamond ore generation was completely removed** from the world
- **Villager trading was disabled**, eliminating the age-old path to enchanted diamond gear
- **The Nether dimension was sealed** for the first two weeks, preventing quick travel
- **Ender eye crafting was disabled**, making the End dimension a distant dream

These radical modifications weren't merely technical tweaks – they represented a fundamental rethinking of SarCraft's economy and power structure. No longer could players rush to diamond level, quickly gear up, and dominate the server. Instead, they would need to explore dungeons, raid structures, and actually engage with the dangerous world around them.

"_The two-week Minecraft phase is dead,_" [[WhoIsFishie]] declared, referencing the server's historical tendency to burn bright but brief. "_Season 10 is built to last._"

### February 11th - Cracks in the Foundation

Tensions emerged when [[WhoIsFishie]] suggested a more seamless authentication plugin, which [[iBattus]] and [[shihaam_me]] rejected. The situation escalated when [[shihaam_me]] was quoted saying:

> Who cares about what [[WhoIsFishie]] wants

In response, [[WhoIsFishie]] created a poll to determine who actually cared about his input. ![[who cares what fishie wants poll results.png]]

Upon seeing the poll results favoring [[WhoIsFishie]], [[shihaam_me]] deleted all chat history related to the authentication plugin discussion. He later explained his opposition to seamless login was due to Microsoft deleting his account when he refused to migrate.

### February 12th - Broken Peace

The debate over authentication plugins continued, leading to the collapse of the truce between [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]]. ![[fishie vs ibattus over auth plugin chat log.png]]

### February 22nd - Reconciliation

A pivotal Telegram call took place with key players:

- [[iBattus]]
- [[WhoIsFishie]]
- [[shihaam_me]]
- [[Anoojfunaid]]
- [[Buhkiru]]
- [[athphane]]
- [[FlameXode]]


During this discussion, [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] attempted to convince [[athphane]] to support abandoning the Telegram-based authentication plugin responsible for the [[Exploits#Identity Theft]] vulnerability. After extensive negotiations, [[iBattus]] and [[shihaam_me]] agreed to switch to EasyAuth, and the peace between [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] and [[iBattus]] was restored.

[[iBattus]] would also return as an admin for this season
## Mods and changes
Season 10 started with a lot of pre planning due to collaboration from [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]]   


> [!NOTE] For a complete list of modifications and changes, see [[ChangeLog]]

## Week 1

### ToadGod's Quiet Return as ToadBlaze 

Season 10 witnessed the unexpected return of [[ToadGod]], a legendary figure from SarCraft's early history who hadn't been seen since the collapse of Season 3. His arrival under a new username `ToadBlaze` was notable primarily in the server logs rather than in the gameworld itself, with only veteran players recognizing the connection to the influential ToadGod of old. 

Unlike the revolutionary firebrand who once led server-wide votes and championed the [[Spawn Mason]]'s community ideals, ToadBlaze chose to keep a low profile in Season 10. Most current players knew neither his former nor current persona, recognizing his name only through server chronicles and old chat logs, if at all. 

The man who once deposed the [[Nazi]] leadership and inadvertently triggered the "Diamond Penis Incident" that ended Season 3 now kept largely to himself, avoiding the factional politics and server-wide drama that had become SarCraft's hallmark in his absence. Whether this reflected a change in his approach or simply caution in a server landscape that had evolved dramatically during his seven-season absence remained to be seen.

TODO : add section to explain the creation of Chicken hill
### The Four Corners Expedition

In a daring display of early-game exploration, [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Donut]] accomplished the seemingly impossible: visiting all four world borders in just three days. Supported by [[Chicken Factory]] members [[Klen04]] and [[Buhkiru]], the duo set out with carefully prepared diamond gear and a strategic plan.

#### The Journey

- **Day 1**: Extensive resource gathering and preparation
- **Day 2**:
    - Reached Northern Border (z:-10000)
    - Marked with a sign (accidentally misdated as "20-March")
    - Proceeded to Eastern Border (x:10000)
- **Day 3**:
    - Conquered Western Border (x:-10000)
    - Reached Southern Border (z:10000)
    - Brought along dogs with storage chests, leading to comical rescue missions

#### Challenges

The expedition wasn't without its hurdles. Wandering dogs, treacherous terrain, and the sheer scale of the journey tested the explorers' resolve. Yet, [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Donut]] persevered, successfully mapping over 80,000 blocks of terrain.

![[4corners_trip.webp]]




### The Chicken Factory Infighting

A tense chapter in SarCraft history unfolded when [[Perhaps]] crafted a legendary weapon - a god sword named after the infamous blade [[Anoojfunaid]] used to slay [[Ssahan]] during the brutal conflicts of [[Season 9]].

What began as a simple naming ceremony spiraled into chaos when [[Nausham]], seeing an opportunity for mischief, attempted to kill [[Anoojfunaid]] with the very sword named in his honor, hoping the server would announce the weapon's prestigious name in the death message.

Alert to the danger, [[Anoojfunaid]] quickly mounted his trusted steed Michelangelo, triggering a frantic chase across the landscape. For four intense minutes, hunter and hunted weaved through the terrain until [[Perhaps]] dramatically intervened - slaying both Michelangelo and [[Anoojfunaid]] in a shocking betrayal.

Fueled by rage and seeking revenge, [[Anoojfunaid]] commandeered [[Buhkiru]]'s prized horse Juan and fled into the wilderness. His escape was short-lived, however, as he accidentally rode into a deep ravine, resulting in the tragic deaths of both himself and the innocent Juan.

![[juan_grave.webp]]

The server exploded with outrage at this series of misfortunes. Players mobilized against [[Anoojfunaid]], who responded by slaying Adhuray the endermite - a beloved server pet. This final act of defiance crossed an unspoken line, uniting the entire server in condemnation.

![[adhuray_grave.webp]]

As players closed in for vengeance, someone suggested a more civilized approach - a formal trial for [[Anoojfunaid]]'s crimes. Desperate for representation, [[Anoojfunaid]] approached [[Donut]] to serve as his legal counsel, only to be rebuffed when she declared her allegiance to the fallen Adhuray.

In a last attempt, [[Anoojfunaid]] turned to [[Perhaps]] for legal representation, who took offense at not being the first choice for counsel. Surrounded by enemies and abandoned by potential allies, [[Anoojfunaid]] rage-quit the server, vowing never to return - adding his name to the long list of players whose SarCraft careers ended in infamous glory.

### Server Backdoor
On day 4 of the server, members of the [[Chicken Factory]] found themselves growing restless. With time on their hands and mischief in mind, they turned their attention to the Telegram plugin running on the server - the same authentication system written by [[Udit]] that had been a source of exploits in previous seasons.

it all started when [[Buhkiru]] discovered that if there is an _ at the end of the chat msg it wont be shown in the telegram group chat

this would lead to players testing different things on the chat to see if there are any exploits

[[Anoojfunaid]] would find out that you can get the bot to mention players by putting an @ before their username 

[[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Buhkiru]] began methodically testing different injection methods, probing for weaknesses in the system's defenses. Their attempts were persistent but ultimately unsuccessful - the exact formula for command injection remained elusive.

a small break through would be made after [[WhoIsFishie]] goes therough the open source code for the plugin and notice a json escape weakness and run the following command 

```
Message","color":"white"}]
say hello world
```


[[athphane]] would see the chat msgs and leave a ramark saying "bro tryna do the sql injection equivalent to minecraft"

After numerous failed attempts, they eventually grew bored and moved on to other pursuits. But their experimentation hadn't gone unnoticed. [[FlameXode]], silently observing their efforts, took mental notes of their approach.

> [!info] Declassified Information
> Here's what really happened :
> 
> 1. [[WhoIsFishie]] typed a command in chat to give everyone shulker shells
> 2. [[FlameXode]] replied to this message, which triggered the command to actually work
> 3. [[Perhaps]] noticed new shulker shells in his inventory and called [[WhoIsFishie]] about it
> 4. [[WhoIsFishie]] checked his own inventory, found shells, and quickly deleted the command evidence from the group chat
> 5. Everyone would stop trying to exploit in the chat
> 6. [[WhoIsFishie]] called [[Buhkiru]] about their discovery
> 7. The three players had a secret Telegram call and agreed to keep quiet about the shells
> 8. They hid the shells inside bundles to avoid detection
> 9. These bundles were then hidden in secret stashes across the map

### Race To Ender Chest

![[echest_in_temple.jpg]]

With diamond ore disabled and traditional progression paths blocked, Season 10's economy evolved around an entirely new form of wealth – jungle temple ender chests. The [[Chicken Factory]] mobilized its members in an unprecedented treasure hunt spanning the entire world.

The race was on:
- [[Perhaps]] claimed the first victory, locating an ender chest in the southwestern corner
- [[Buhkiru]] secured the second prize on the northern frontier – a structure [[WhoIsFishie]] had narrowly missed during the Four Corners Expedition

With these precious resources secured, [[WhoIsFishie]] couldn't resist flaunting his faction's achievement. He summoned [[Ssahan]] to spawn, intending to display the coveted ender chest and cement the [[Chicken Factory]]'s dominance.

But the display of power backfired spectacularly. While scrolling through his hotbar, [[WhoIsFishie]] revealed a stack of purple concrete that [[Ssahan]] mistook for a shulker box – an impossible item under Season 10's restrictions. Accusations of cheating immediately flooded server chat, reopening old wounds between rival factions.

> [!info] Declassified Information
> The plan to trick [[The Alliance]] went like this:
> 
> 1. [[Klen04]] came up with the idea to confuse [[The Alliance]] by showing a purple shulker box and then quickly switching to purple concrete
> 2. The goal was to make them question what they actually saw
> 3. [[WhoIsFishie]] improved the plan by bringing an ender chest into the mix
> 4. This way, if questioned, he could claim he was only showing off the legitimate ender chest

### The Telegram Exploit and Administrative Crisis

On the fifth day of Season 10, the server's delicate peace shattered. During a casual TikTok livestream by [[WhoIsFishie]], [[FlameXode]] joined the chat and asked if his earlier attempts at exploiting the Telegram integration had been successful.

> [!info] Declassified Information
> Before starting his TikTok livestream:
> 
> 1. [[WhoIsFishie]] broke the rule of not putting shulker in enderchest
> 2. He placed the purple shulker box (that he had previously shown to [[Ssahan]]) into his ender chest
> 3. This mistake would later become evidence used against him
> 4. This purple shulker was the same one used in the earlier psychological operation

When [[WhoIsFishie]] replied that they hadn't worked, [[FlameXode]] proceeded to demonstrate the correct exploitation technique. It turned out [[WhoIsFishie]] had only performed one of the two steps needed to trigger the command injection. When [[FlameXode]] executed the full exploit, the server granted everyone online two shulker shells - items that should have been impossible to obtain in the season's progression.

Players online during the exploit included:
- [[Ssahan]] - 4 shells
- [[WhoIsFishie]] - 4 shells (burned)
- [[iBattus]] - 2 shells 
- [[yeetuz]] - 4 shells 
- [[invisble715|Pumkin715]] - 2 shells

[[WhoIsFishie]], broadcasting live to his audience, immediately destroyed his shells, declaring them "illegal contraband." The fate of the other shells remained uncertain, but suspicion fell heavily on [[WhoIsFishie]].

> [!info] Declassified Information
> [[WhoIsFishie]] had no issue burning his shulker shells as he had multiple stashes of the shells
> this was also done to pressure any of [[The Alliance]] to also burn theirs


[[iBattus]], reinstated as an administrator for Season 10, seized the opportunity. Using his elevated permissions, he inspected [[WhoIsFishie]]'s ender chest, discovering what appeared to be an illegitimate shulker box.

![[fishie_echest.jpg]]

The evidence was posted in the SarCraft group chat, seemingly confirming [[WhoIsFishie]]'s guilt. Yet [[WhoIsFishie]] vehemently denied the accusations, claiming [[iBattus]] had planted the evidence to frame him and validate [[Ssahan]]'s earlier suspicions.

"_If I owned a shulker box, it would be red,_" [[WhoIsFishie]] insisted, referencing his well-documented preference for the color. [[shihaam_me]], in a rare moment of intervention, confirmed this quirk of [[WhoIsFishie]]'s character.

The controversy escalated further when [[WhoIsFishie]] accused [[iBattus]] of administrative abuse, inspecting his ender chest without proper authorization or a server court order.

In the chaos that followed, [[shihaam_me]] disabled Minecraft message forwarding to the Telegram group, preventing further exploitation of the vulnerability. Later that night, the server went offline as [[FlameXode]] attempted to deploy an emergency patch to fix the [[Exploits#Telegram Command Injection|Telegram Command Injection]] exploit once and for all.

The first week of Season 10 had delivered more drama, betrayal, and technical chaos than some entire seasons before it. And this was just the beginning. 

### The Audit

Server would be down till night of day 6  
and would return with the [[Udit]] plugin patched thus patching out any backdoors for the server. 

auditing plugins would be installed to check player inventory and ender chests

the following players would be questioned due to having items with mending 
- [[BuhKiru]]
- [[TheHarryG|12OK]]
- [[WhoIsFishie]]
- [[Anoojfunaid]]
- [[Perhaps]]

players would claim they got it through legal means

[[iBattus]] would then question [[Anoojfunaid]] about the [[Exploits#Hacked Helmet]]

[[Anoojfunaid]], [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Buhkiru]] would get on a call where [[WhoIsFishie]] tell [[Buhkiru]] about the helmet situation

during this call [[Buhkiru]] would learn that the server has been exploited and that [[Anoojfunaid]] was hacking

during this call [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Anoojfunaid]] would forget to mute their mic so [[shihaam_me]] heard part of what was said 

[[shihaam_me]] would over hear [[WhoIsFishie]] talking about hacks and incorrectly assume he was hacking 

this would lead to players getting banned
- [[WhoIsFishie]] : 1 count of hacking
- [[Anoojfunaid]] : 1 count of illegal items

[[Donut]] and [[TheHarryG|12OK]] would be appointed as lawyers for [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Anoojfunaid]]
the team would compile proof of [[WhoIsFishie]] not using clients as he was clean the entire season

[[athphane]] would be the judge over seeing the case with [[shihaam_me]] and [[iBattus]] being the prosecutor 

while this is happening [[shihaam_me]] and [[iBattus]] would go through server logs and discover even more sus things things leading to [[Perhaps]] getting banned for alleged flying and owning illegal items

```
Perhaps has Diamond Chestplate, Ender Chest, cokestone via cheat 
he also seems to use a flying hack

AnoojFunaid has Diamond Helmet via cheat
```

```
diamond_swordcustom_name='["",{"text":"cokestone","italic":false}]',enchantments={levels:{fire_aspect:1000,knockback:1000,looting:1000,mending:1,sharpness:1000,unbreaking:1000,vanishing_curse:1}}
```

the [[Chicken Factory]] would submit a case against the state

**Chicken Factory V The State** 

1. one count of illegal search and seizure and abuse of administrative power for [[shihaam_me]]. 
2. two counts of wiretapping for [[shihaam_me]]. 
3. one count of negligence for both [[iBattus]] and [[shihaam_me]]

### The Trial of the Century 

In what would become known as one of the most significant judicial proceedings in SarCraft history, "The State vs Axis Powers" trial began on March 7th. With [[athphane]] presiding as judge, the court sought to determine the fate of the three banned players and address the alleged administrative overreach. 

the following players were attending the hearing as civilians 
- [[FrumpleX]]
- [[FlameXode]]
- [[ToadGod|ToadBlaze]]
- [[Klen04]]
- [[StrawBwabii]]

this would be the highest server player count this season 

many other players would be watching the hearing on the telegram live stream 

The 2 hour trial featured dramatic testimony, technical demonstrations, and several shocking revelations: 
- [[iBattus]] was caught submitting misdated evidence, claiming certain logs were from February 5th when the server hadn't even launched until February 28th 
- [[Buhkiru]] demonstrated legitimate methods of obtaining mending enchantments that [[The Alliance]] had simply failed to discover 
- [[Perhaps]] was found guilty of flying but not of item spawning 
- [[Anoojfunaid]] negotiated a plea deal for a reduced ban after admitting to possession of illegal items 
- [[WhoIsFishie]] was cleared of all major charges, with the judge determining the alleged shulker box was merely "purple concrete" 

Perhaps most remarkably, [[shihaam_me]] himself sided with the defendants at several key moments, describing the prosecution's arguments as "a [[iBattus]] skill issue." This fracturing of the administrative alliance revealed deeper tensions within the server's governance structure. 

By the trial's conclusion, [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Perhaps]] were unbanned, [[Anoojfunaid]] received a reduced sentence of just two days, and Judge [[athphane]] had secured himself both diamonds and a promised set of mending armor from the [[Chicken Factory]]. 

> [!NOTE] For the complete trial proceedings, see [[State vs Axis]] 


## Week 2

the server would go quite as everyone took their time to take in the footage from the court hearings. players would spend more of their time speaking of the court case. 

[[iBattus]] and [[WhoIsFishie]] would have some disagreements in the group chat but for the time being nothing happened on the server.

[[iBattus]] : Man logs don't lie, I don't wanna argue about this with you, You would hold a cigarette and make the person Infront believe you don't have a cigarette

![[cat_posts_meme.jpg]]  
_meme sent to the group chat by [[CatMDV|Cat]]_

[[CatMDV|Cat]] would have some strong words to say about how the court hearing went as he was not happy about [[athphane]] being too lenient on the accused.

- [[CatMDV|Cat]] : I am looking at what i see is Sodom
- [[CatMDV|Cat]] : i've see 1 year old infants getting scolded stronger than whatever the hell that "court" was
- [[CatMDV|Cat]] : [[shihaam_me]] have AI write lengthy laws and regulation documents so that the next court case doesn't turn in to a jester circus like the last one did

in the end no one really cared for what [[CatMDV|Cat]] said cause he wasn't an active player in the first week of Season 10

### Nether Update
00:00 at 10th March the nether update is released giving players access to the nether. 

[[Buhkiru]] would find ancient debris

moments after [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Donut]] would also go into the nether and collect blaze rods

by a coincidence [[TheHarryG|12OK]], [[Donut]], [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Buhkiru]] would all get wither skeleton skulls at the same time 

[[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Donut]] would go to explore a bastion remnant and find ancient debris

### 100 deaths

[[Alex]] a player famous for his death count would be reaching 100 deaths. [[WhoIsFishie]] would start bidding to be his 100th death reason. the final settlement would allow [[WhoIsFishie]] to kill [[Alex]] 5 times in exchange for 6 diamonds per death. [[WhoIsFishie]] would kill [[Alex]] 5 times and pay him as soon as he reached 100 deaths. this marks the first 100 deaths on SarCraft history 
### Murder on SarCraft

11th March 2025

a player named [[PrincipleOf_AIS]] who joined SarCraft sometime in week 1 of Season 10 would be out exploring when he came across [[The Alliance]]'s base. not much is known about the exchange but [[PrincipleOf_AIS]] would be killed by [[Ssahan]] under [[iBattus]]'s orders for spying and trespassing.  

[[PrincipleOf_AIS]] a player who was not allied to any faction has been killed 5k blocks away from spawn

[[PrincipleOf_AIS]] would deny any spying or trespassing allegations and would say he never entered [[iBattus]]'s base 

![[ais_spying.jpg]]

later things got heated and [[PrincipleOf_AIS]] would leak [[The Alliance]]'s base location. [[iBattus]] angry over this would have [[PrincipleOf_AIS]]'s items burned.

the rest of the server watched as this unusual cruel behavior was taken place on a new player and it was condemned by the [[Chicken Factory]] members.

[[shihaam_me]] would show up due to all the argument to see what was going on

[[PrincipleOf_AIS]] in retaliation to his items burning would start snitching on [[The Alliance]] stating that he saw them jumping very high. alluding to the use of hacked clients among [[The Alliance]] members

[[shihaam_me]] would ban [[Ssahan]] and [[iBattus]] until a court hearing 

>[!info] Declassified Information The truth about the [[PrincipleOf_AIS]] incident:
>
>1. [[PrincipleOf_AIS]] was not an innocent player - he was sent by [[WhoIsFishie]] as part of a plan
>2. AXIS had already completed several successful recon missions at [[The Alliance]]'s base when members were offline
>3. [[PrincipleOf_AIS]] was specifically instructed to get caught and create drama
>4. When [[PrincipleOf_AIS]] noticed [[The Alliance]] members using hacked clients, he went off-script to gather evidence
>5. [[The Alliance]] detected [[PrincipleOf_AIS]] on their ESP hacks and moved to eliminate him
>6. [[PrincipleOf_AIS]] spotted them approaching via free cam, logged out, and contacted [[WhoIsFishie]] for new instructions
>7. [[WhoIsFishie]] told him to play dumb and provoke them further
>8. [[WhoIsFishie]] alerted [[Chicken Factory]] members to be ready to escalate the situation in group chat
>9. When [[Ssahan]] killed [[PrincipleOf_AIS]], the coordinates were leaked publicly - exactly as planned

### 89 seconds to midnight
the dooms day clock on SarCraft would be moved to 89 seconds to midnight as [[Chicken Factory]] would make their way to [[The Alliance]]'s base now that its leaked and [[iBattus]] and [[Ssahan]] are banned

they would find [[yeetuz]]'s pets there

![[miss_mika.webp]]
[[WhoIsFishie]] would post a picture of the pets with the caption
"i miss [[Mika]]"

tension would rise as [[WhoIsFishie]] threaten to kill the dogs to avenge [[Mika]]

the factory members would leave after a few hours and no pets were killed.

### Court Case 

> [!NOTE] For the complete trial proceedings, see [[PrincipleOf_AIS vs The Alliance]]
 
### Era of Peace

Week 2 would end with players starting to play together a lot more. Several significant developments shaped this period:

#### Community Revival

- [[CatMDV|Cat]] returned to the server
- [[ToadGod|ToadBlaze]] reinvigorated the [[Spawn Mason]] faction
- [[Chicken Factory]] established a peace agreement with players at spawn

#### Infrastructure Projects

- [[Buhkiru]] constructed a nether highway
- [[WhoIsFishie]] began an overworld tunnel system
- [[Buhkiru]] built the Black Pearl at spawn

#### Base Developments

- [[Chicken Factory]] base became public as members split off to make their own bases
- The original Chicken Factory headquarters became [[Buhkiru]]'s personal base
- [[ToadGod|ToadBlaze]] developed his base at spawn
- [[shihaam_me]] ventured about 4,000 blocks from spawn to start building his world-famous cube
    - This project was temporarily paused when [[TheHarryG|12OK]] offered to buy 14,000 dirt blocks in exchange for diamonds
    - [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Perhaps]] made the journey to visit [[shihaam_me]] and deliver diamonds

Overall, the end of week 2 and beginning of week 3 marked the most peaceful period the server had experienced, characterized by collaborative building projects and reduced factional tensions.


## Week 3

### The TSA Incident: Border Tension and Hostage Crisis

On March 18th, 2025, another such confrontation unfolded—one that would become known as "The TSA Incident and Hostage Crisis."

#### The Intrusion

It began like many conflicts on SarCraft: with an unexpected visitor in claimed territory. As [[Buhkiru]] logged into the server, he immediately noticed something alarming—[[iBattus]], a member of [[The Alliance]] and longtime rival of the [[Chicken Factory]], standing suspiciously inside Chicken Factory territory.

"Why are u just there?" Buhkiru questioned, his suspicion evident.

The situation escalated quickly when [[WhoIsFishie]] joined the server. Recognizing the potential threat of having a rival faction member within their borders, he immediately instituted an improvised security protocol.

"If you come here you must go through TSA," WhoIsFishie declared, establishing what would become one of the most contentious border policies in Season 10.

#### The TSA Standoff

What exactly was the "TSA" that WhoIsFishie demanded? Much like its real-world counterpart, the SarCraft TSA (Territory Security Administration) required visitors to submit to an inventory inspection—or as WhoIsFishie colorfully put it, "a cavity search."

The terms were simple: show your inventory to prove you haven't stolen anything, or face immediate expulsion—likely at the end of a Netherite sword. In SarCraft's brutal implementation of border security, a "cavity search" typically involved killing uncooperative players and checking their dropped items—a grim but effective method of inventory inspection.

"Our land, our rules," WhoIsFishie stated firmly, embodying the territorial sovereignty that had defined faction politics since the earliest seasons.

[[iBattus]], no stranger to SarCraft conflict and a veteran of multiple wars, refused to comply with the demand. "I don't wanna show inv," he insisted, despite [[Buhkiru]]'s repeated warnings.

As Buhkiru's patience wore thin, he issued his final warning: "Show inv or I'm killing u."

Faced with this ultimatum and surrounded by Chicken Factory forces, [[Ssahan]] made the decision that has long been controversial in SarCraft history—he combat logged, disconnecting from the server to avoid potential death and item loss.

"He logged," Buhkiru announced, confirming what many considered to be a cardinal sin in server etiquette.

When [[Ssahan]] rejoined the server, he attempted to defuse the situation by showing his inventory, claiming: "I raided a desert ruin and got these, believe it or not." But the Chicken Factory members remained suspicious, particularly of the enchanted books in his possession.

"I need to see enchants," Buhkiru demanded, concerned that valuable books might have been stolen from his chests.

[[Ssahan]] protested his innocence: "There is none that I took from u," but the Chicken Factory wasn't convinced. As tensions escalated, [[Perhaps]] joined the security detail, and [[Anoojfunaid]] arrived to reinforce their position.

#### The Hostage Situation

What began as a border security check transformed into something far more serious: a hostage situation. When [[Ssahan]] asked "Can I leave?" he was met with a chilling response from Buhkiru:

"Ure not leaving till [[iBattus]] comes back."

The Chicken Factory had effectively taken [[Ssahan]] prisoner, using him as leverage against [[iBattus]]. The faction was now demanding that [[iBattus]] submit to his authority and provide his replay file—a recording of his actions on the server that might reveal any theft.

"You give us your replay file and we let him go," [[WhoIsFishie]] declared, establishing clear hostage negotiation terms.

As [[iBattus]] protested through the Telegram chat, [[Perhaps]] ominously asked [[Ssahan]]: "Have you ever heard of the term prison wife?"

Desperate to free his ally, [[iBattus]] appealed directly to the server's highest authority: "shihaam_me what is this," he pleaded repeatedly, attempting to summon the server owner to intervene in what he perceived as unjust imprisonment.

The Chicken Factory's response was immediate and threatening. "If u spam the kid dies," [[Perhaps]] warned, escalating the hostage situation to new heights.

Under this pressure, [[iBattus]] finally relented, sharing an image of his inventory in the Telegram chat: "Here is my inv, ffs."

But even this concession wasn't enough. "You could have hidden items," [[WhoIsFishie]] countered, while [[Perhaps]] added: "2 ender chests is sus."

![[sshana_escape.webm]]

As negotiations reached an impasse, the [[Chicken Factory ]]began formalizing their improvised hostage-taking. [[Buhkiru]] issued a series of commands that revealed their intentions: "Box this area. Remove water. Below that. Box that."

![[sshan_box.jpg]]

They were constructing a proper prison cell around [[Ssahan]], transforming what had begun as a simple border check into a full-scale hostage crisis that would echo the obsidian imprisonment techniques used against [[iBattus]] himself in previous seasons.

The hostage situation eventually dissipated without administrative intervention. While [[shihaam_me]] briefly appeared in the Telegram chat, he merely joked about the situation rather than taking action, stating "Because you can't attend court if I don't allow you to" when players suggested a trial.

By the end of the day, [[iBattus]] had effectively abandoned negotiations for [[Ssahan]]'s release, eventually telling the Chicken Factory to "Kill him" when they proposed further talks. This callous dismissal prompted [[WhoIsFishie]] to remark that [[iBattus]] was "tryna make us catch a case."

[[iBattus]] was later accused of being on a hacked client by [[shihaam_me]] himself, who asked directly in the Telegram chat: "are you on a hacked client." This accusation was particularly ironic given that earlier the same day, [[iBattus]] had accused [[Buhkiru]] of flying hacks after seeing him use `Avas Ride`, a trident with riptide.

In a final twist of irony, [[TheHarryG|12OK]] shared a link to a [website](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/tantrums.html#:~:text=If%20a%20tantrum%20happens%20after,best%20to%20ignore%20the%20tantrum) about handling tantrums in children, a barbed reference to [[iBattus]]'s repeated complaints to [[shihaam_me]] about the hostage situation.

### The Failed Peace Accord and Unwhitelisting

On March 19th, the consequences of the hostage crisis continued to reverberate through the server. The day began with [[Buhkiru]] attempting to sweeten the deal for [[Ssahan]]'s release, proposing: "I'll make the deal even sweeter. You give me 64 dirt block and he is free to go. But you and only you will be KOS [Kill On Sight]. If Sahan or yeetuz comes to the base they are KOS too."

In a significant diplomatic move, [[WhoIsFishie]] unveiled a formal peace agreement: "The Chicken Factory is ready to make a peace treaty in the interest of preserving builds and farms on the server and to avoid acts of terror that took place last season." He shared a link to an official document titled "[[PEACE ACCORD]]," noting that "this agreement also protects pets and not just builds."

The document seemed like a major step toward stability after the hostilities of previous days—but the optimism would be short-lived.

#### The Jail Break and Threats

Rather than engaging with the peace proposal, [[Ssahan]] executed a daring escape from his prison cell. he fails and burns to death, his first message to the server after this was ominous: "u lot gonna die soon." This threat set the tone for what would become a day of escalating tensions.

#### The Alliance Collapse

As the day progressed, the tension reached a breaking point. In what would become a pivotal moment in Season 10 politics, [[iBattus]] left the SarCraft group chat entirely, effectively withdrawing from server politics in dramatic fashion.

The server logs captured [[WhoIsFishie]]'s reaction:

> "Damn, there goes my batman."

[[Perhaps]] observed with equal parts sarcasm and insight:

> "Can't believe we did nothing this season and he still got mad." "Average SarCraft season without the killings."

#### Administrative Intervention

At approximately 17:10 server time, [[iBattus]] briefly returned to the server, announcing cryptically: "wiping stuffs." This immediately triggered concern among [[Chicken Factory]] members that he might be preparing to destroy his base or engage in acts of retaliation.

This action would put [[Chicken Factory]]'s doomsday clock to 58 seconds. [[Buhkiru]] would take everyone's pets to Exploit Island to keep them safe incase the Chicken Hill gets nuked

When questioned by [[shihaam_me]] about his purpose for logging in, [[iBattus]] doubled down on his hostile stance: "you are bad admin, good for chicken factory."

Sensing the potential for significant server damage, [[shihaam_me]] took the extraordinary step of unwhitelisting both [[iBattus]] and [[Ssahan]] from the server—not quite a ban, but effectively removing their ability to access the game world.

Explaining the decision to others in the Telegram chat, [[shihaam_me]] clarified: "theyre not banned, theyre unwhitelisted" – technically allowing them a path to return if they wished to reconcile with the server community.

[[Donut]] and [[StrawBwabii]] would go and egg [[athphane]]'s house and leave signs blaming [[Ssahan]] and [[iBattus]]

#### The Era of Construction

With the immediate threat of conflict diminished by the unwhitelisting, the server entered a brief period of peaceful construction. [[Buhkiru]] and [[StrawBwabii]] began work on an ambitious lush cave project, gathering resources and discussing design plans.

The logs record their collaboration:

-  **[[StrawBwabii]]**: "can i help"
- **[[BuhKiru]]**: "sure" 
- **[[StrawBwabii]]**: "what do we need" 
- **[[BuhKiru]]**: "just stone for now" 
- **[[StrawBwabii]]**: "ik we need moss for them to grow" 
- **[[BuhKiru]]**: "make the cave then decorate"

In a moment of unintentional comedy, [[StrawBwabii]] was briefly accused of flying hacks by [[Buhkiru]], who jokingly called for [[shihaam_me]]'s attention. [[StrawBwabii]] played along: "no don't expose my hacks," highlighting the server's ongoing preoccupation with hacking accusations.

## Week 4

### The ModPack Update

![[elytra-trims1.png]]
In Week 4, the server got a new modpack update to keep things fresh. This update added:

- New decoration blocks for building 
- Elytra trims to make flying gear look cool
- A camera to take pictures

![[beautify-refabricated.png]]

These new items came at a good time, right after all the fighting and drama had settled down.

### The Path to The End

Players started getting ready for the Ender Dragon fight. Everyone was excited as they gathered their best gear for the big battle.

On March 27th, [[shihaam_me]] opened The End dimension. This was a big deal since the server started with no diamonds and a locked Nether. The slow opening of each area had worked well to make the season last longer than the usual "two-week Minecraft phase."

The [[Chicken Factory]] would delay the first dragon event because they wanted all their members there. [[WhoIsFishie]], who was hurt in real life, told everyone to go ahead without him. [[Donut]], who was traveling, said the same thing.

### SarCube
[[Buhkiru]] would document the building of the SarCube for this season

### End raid

After weeks of preparation and strategic planning, the long-awaited End dimension raid finally took place on March 30th. 

[[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Donut]] would join the end raid while on vacation. [[Anoojfunaid]] would miss the raid because he fell asleep 

The [[Chicken Factory]] made a diplomatic gesture by inviting [[ToadGod|ToadBlaze]] to join the expedition, strengthening relations with the [[Spawn Mason]] faction.

What came as a surprise to the raiding party was that the Ender Dragon had been significantly modified with new mechanics and attacks. Players had to adapt to these changes in real-time and work together to defeat the enhanced dragon.

The modified dragon featured numerous changes including:

- Increased health from 200 HP to 300 HP
- A new dive attack creating massive shockwaves when hitting the ground
- A "Triple Dive" variant when the dragon reached 75% health
- Chain-fired dragon fireballs that dealt direct impact damage
- A devastating laser attack
- Phantom guardians protecting the end crystals
- A dramatic final phase where the dragon hovered, forcing players to levitate and deliver the killing blow mid-air
- Boss music that played to all players on the center island
- Blue soul fire replacing standard fire on end crystals

The fight was further complicated by the dragon's increased knockback resistance, which prevented the traditional strategy of locking it in place with arrows. Additionally, dragon breath effects lasted twice as long as normal, creating dangerous zones throughout the battle arena.

When the dragon reached 10% health, it became temporarily immune to damage until perched, forcing players to adapt their strategy for the final phase.

After an intense battle, the group succeeded in defeating the enhanced dragon, with [[WhoIsFishie]] claiming the egg as his prize. Everyone within 128 blocks of the center island received the "Free the End" advancement to commemorate their victory.

Following the dragon fight, the team made their way through the End dimension to raid end cities, collecting valuable shulker shells and elytra wings to bring back to the overworld.
## Past the 4 weeks

With the planned 4 weeks of SarCraft coming to an end, [[shihaam_me]] decided to let the server continue running without further updates or maintenance. The Season 10 world would remain active as long as players continued to engage with it.

### Continued Activity

Despite reaching the official end of the planned season, several dedicated players maintained their presence on the server:

- [[StrawBwabii]] continued expanding her elaborate base, adding intricate details and new structures
- [[WhoIsFishie]] worked on finishing his ambitious underground complex
- [[dannyzek]] remained one of the most active players, regularly logging in to continue his projects
- [[Buhkiru]] focused on documenting the famous [[SarCube]] that had become a server landmark
- [[ToadGod|ToadBlaze]] continued developing the revitalized [[Spawn Mason]] headquarters

### Community Renaissance

Season 10 distinguished itself as the most artistically productive season in SarCraft history. Unlike previous seasons that focused primarily on faction warfare and political maneuvering, Season 10 fostered an unprecedented era of creativity and community expression:

- [[StrawBwabii]] created drawings of the [[Chicken Factory]] members, which were shared throughout the community
- [[FlameXode]] produced a voiceover for [[Buhkiru]]'s documentary chronicling the creation of the [[SarCube]]	
- [[invisble715|Pumkin715]] animated key moments from the historic "State vs Axis" trial, preserving the dramatic courtroom exchanges

This extended period of peace and creativity helped cement Season 10's reputation as one of the most successful and enjoyable seasons in SarCraft history, proving that the modified gameplay mechanics had indeed succeeded in extending the server's lifespan beyond the dreaded "two-week Minecraft phase."



## Anooj Wedding
on the midnight of 10th april [[Anoojfunaid]] would finally have his wedding after multiple failed attempts. with his wedding he would announce to the server that he will be retiring from sarcraft. 

server would be shut down at 10:20pm maldivian time on the 10th of april
## Fishie's Retirement 

[[WhoIsFishie]] officially retired after five seasons on SarCraft. This was no surprise, as he had been hinting at stepping back for some time. 

"*The time has come to pass the torch,*" Fishie told everyone in [[Chicken Factory]]. After years of faction fights, court cases, and helping with server tech, he was stepping back from playing regularly.

The [[Chicken Factory]] would now be led by [[Buhkiru]], Fishie's friend and ally. This was the end of an era for the server and the start of something new for the faction that had been so powerful for many seasons.

Fishie said he would still help with server maintenance and show up for special events, but wouldn't be an active player in future seasons.

He explained he was retiring because of changes in his life and wanting to spend more time with family and work. This showed how the server community had grown up along with its players.

As [[Buhkiru]] took over the [[Chicken Factory]], everyone wondered what would happen next. Would the faction stay strong with a new leader? Or would this change shake up the server's power balance?

Only time would tell what would happen to the [[Chicken Factory]] now. But everyone knew that [[WhoIsFishie]] had left his mark on SarCraft's history.
