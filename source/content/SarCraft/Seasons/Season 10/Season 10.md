In the continuing saga of SarCraft history, Season 10 stands as a testament to both reconciliation and innovation. Before the season's launch, a significant amount of behind-the-scenes preparation took place, including a momentous peace agreement between longtime rivals [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]]. To prevent the infamous "2 week Minecraft phase" that had plagued previous seasons, gameplay changes were implemented to artificially slow player progression. [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]], in collaboration with [[iBattus]], developed mods that would fundamentally alter gameplay mechanics.

## Pre-Launch Developments

### February 4th - The White Flag

On February 4th, 2025, the unthinkable happened. After years of bitter rivalry spanning multiple seasons, [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]] – the server's most legendary antagonists – reached out across enemy lines to negotiate peace.

The server was stunned. Veterans who had witnessed the [[Season 5|Age of Revolution]], the [[Season 8|Fish Bundy Trials]], and the [[Season 9|Great War]] could scarcely believe these mortal enemies had finally buried the hatchet. The white flag had been raised, and for a brief, shining moment, peace seemed possible.

### February 5th - The Modded Revolution

With the historic peace agreement signed, attention turned to Season 10's ambitious technical overhaul. For the first time in server history, [[shihaam_me]] activated a suite of game-changing mods designed by the unlikely partnership of [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]].

The most controversial changes struck at the very heart of Minecraft progression:

- **Diamond ore generation was completely removed** from the world
- **Villager trading was disabled**, eliminating the age-old path to enchanted diamond gear
- **The Nether dimension was sealed** for the first two weeks, preventing quick travel
- **Ender eye crafting was disabled**, making the End dimension a distant dream

These radical modifications weren't merely technical tweaks – they represented a fundamental rethinking of SarCraft's economy and power structure. No longer could players rush to diamond level, quickly gear up, and dominate the server. Instead, they would need to explore dungeons, raid structures, and actually engage with the dangerous world around them.

"_The two-week Minecraft phase is dead,_" [[WhoIsFishie]] declared, referencing the server's historical tendency to burn bright but brief. "_Season 10 is built to last._"

### February 11th - Cracks in the Foundation

Tensions emerged when [[WhoIsFishie]] suggested a more seamless authentication plugin, which [[iBattus]] and [[shihaam_me]] rejected. The situation escalated when [[shihaam_me]] was quoted saying:

> Who cares about what [[WhoIsFishie]] wants

In response, [[WhoIsFishie]] created a poll to determine who actually cared about his input. ![[who cares what fishie wants poll results.png]]

Upon seeing the poll results favoring [[WhoIsFishie]], [[shihaam_me]] deleted all chat history related to the authentication plugin discussion. He later explained his opposition to seamless login was due to Microsoft deleting his account when he refused to migrate.

### February 12th - Broken Peace

The debate over authentication plugins continued, leading to the collapse of the truce between [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]]. ![[fishie vs ibattus over auth plugin chat log.png]]

### February 22nd - Reconciliation

A pivotal Telegram call took place with key players:

- [[iBattus]]
- [[WhoIsFishie]]
- [[shihaam_me]]
- [[Anoojfunaid]]
- [[Buhkiru]]
- [[athphane]]
- [[FlameXode]]


During this discussion, [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] attempted to convince [[athphane]] to support abandoning the Telegram-based authentication plugin responsible for the [[Exploits#Identity Theft]] vulnerability. After extensive negotiations, [[iBattus]] and [[shihaam_me]] agreed to switch to EasyAuth, and the peace between [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] and [[iBattus]] was restored.

[[iBattus]] would also return as an admin for this season

## Week 1

### ToadGod's Quiet Return as ToadBlaze 

Season 10 witnessed the unexpected return of [[ToadGod]], a legendary figure from SarCraft's early history who hadn't been seen since the collapse of Season 3. His arrival under a new username `ToadBlaze` was notable primarily in the server logs rather than in the gameworld itself, with only veteran players recognizing the connection to the influential ToadGod of old. 

Unlike the revolutionary firebrand who once led server-wide votes and championed the [[Spawn Mason]]'s community ideals, ToadBlaze chose to keep a low profile in Season 10. Most current players knew neither his former nor current persona, recognizing his name only through server chronicles and old chat logs, if at all. 

The man who once deposed the [[Nazi]] leadership and inadvertently triggered the "Diamond Penis Incident" that ended Season 3 now kept largely to himself, avoiding the factional politics and server-wide drama that had become SarCraft's hallmark in his absence. Whether this reflected a change in his approach or simply caution in a server landscape that had evolved dramatically during his seven-season absence remained to be seen.
### The Four Corners Expedition

In a daring display of early-game exploration, [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Donut]] accomplished the seemingly impossible: visiting all four world borders in just three days. Supported by [[Chicken Factory]] members [[Klen04]] and [[Buhkiru]], the duo set out with carefully prepared diamond gear and a strategic plan.

#### The Journey

- **Day 1**: Extensive resource gathering and preparation
- **Day 2**:
    - Reached Northern Border (z:-10000)
    - Marked with a sign (accidentally misdated as "20-March")
    - Proceeded to Eastern Border (x:10000)
- **Day 3**:
    - Conquered Western Border (x:-10000)
    - Reached Southern Border (z:10000)
    - Brought along dogs with storage chests, leading to comical rescue missions

#### Challenges

The expedition wasn't without its hurdles. Wandering dogs, treacherous terrain, and the sheer scale of the journey tested the explorers' resolve. Yet, [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Donut]] persevered, successfully mapping over 80,000 blocks of terrain.

### The Chicken Factory Infighting

A tense chapter in SarCraft history unfolded when [[Perhaps]] crafted a legendary weapon - a god sword named after the infamous blade [[Anoojfunaid]] used to slay [[Ssahan]] during the brutal conflicts of [[Season 9]].

What began as a simple naming ceremony spiraled into chaos when [[Nausham]], seeing an opportunity for mischief, attempted to kill [[Anoojfunaid]] with the very sword named in his honor, hoping the server would announce the weapon's prestigious name in the death message.

Alert to the danger, [[Anoojfunaid]] quickly mounted his trusted steed Michelangelo, triggering a frantic chase across the landscape. For four intense minutes, hunter and hunted weaved through the terrain until [[Perhaps]] dramatically intervened - slaying both Michelangelo and [[Anoojfunaid]] in a shocking betrayal.

Fueled by rage and seeking revenge, [[Anoojfunaid]] commandeered [[Buhkiru]]'s prized horse Juan and fled into the wilderness. His escape was short-lived, however, as he accidentally rode into a deep ravine, resulting in the tragic deaths of both himself and the innocent Juan.

The server exploded with outrage at this series of misfortunes. Players mobilized against [[Anoojfunaid]], who responded by slaying Adhuray the endermite - a beloved server pet. This final act of defiance crossed an unspoken line, uniting the entire server in condemnation.

As players closed in for vengeance, someone suggested a more civilized approach - a formal trial for [[Anoojfunaid]]'s crimes. Desperate for representation, [[Anoojfunaid]] approached [[Donut]] to serve as his legal counsel, only to be rebuffed when she declared her allegiance to the fallen Adhuray.

In a last attempt, [[Anoojfunaid]] turned to [[Perhaps]] for legal representation, who took offense at not being the first choice for counsel. Surrounded by enemies and abandoned by potential allies, [[Anoojfunaid]] rage-quit the server, vowing never to return - adding his name to the long list of players whose SarCraft careers ended in infamous glory.



### Server Backdoor
On day 4 of the server, members of the [[Chicken Factory]] found themselves growing restless. With time on their hands and mischief in mind, they turned their attention to the Telegram plugin running on the server - the same authentication system written by [[Udit]] that had been a source of exploits in previous seasons.

it all started when [[Buhkiru]] discovered that if there is an _ at the end of the chat msg it wont be shown in the telegram group chat

this would lead to players testing different things on the chat to see if there are any exploits

[[Anoojfunaid]] would find out that you can get the bot to mention players by putting an @ before their username 

[[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Buhkiru]] began methodically testing different injection methods, probing for weaknesses in the system's defenses. Their attempts were persistent but ultimately unsuccessful - the exact formula for command injection remained elusive.

a small break through would be made after [[WhoIsFishie]] goes therough the open source code for the plugin and notice a json escape weakness and run the following command 

```
Message","color":"white"}]
say hello world
```



[[athphane]] would see the chat msgs and leave a ramark saying "bro tryna do the sql injection equivalent to minecraft"



After numerous failed attempts, they eventually grew bored and moved on to other pursuits. But their experimentation hadn't gone unnoticed. [[FlameXode]], silently observing their efforts, took mental notes of their approach. Unlike his compatriots, he didn't abandon the pursuit - he merely waited for the right moment.

### Race To Ender Chest

![[echest_in_temple.jpg]]

With diamond ore disabled and traditional progression paths blocked, Season 10's economy evolved around an entirely new form of wealth – jungle temple ender chests. The [[Chicken Factory]] mobilized its members in an unprecedented treasure hunt spanning the entire world.

The race was on:

- [[Perhaps]] claimed the first victory, locating an ender chest in the southwestern corner
- [[Buhkiru]] secured the second prize on the northern frontier – a structure [[WhoIsFishie]] had narrowly missed during the Four Corners Expedition

With these precious resources secured, [[WhoIsFishie]] couldn't resist flaunting his faction's achievement. He summoned [[Ssahan]] to spawn, intending to display the coveted ender chest and cement the [[Chicken Factory]]'s dominance.

But the display of power backfired spectacularly. While scrolling through his hotbar, [[WhoIsFishie]] revealed a stack of purple concrete that [[Ssahan]] mistook for a shulker box – an impossible item under Season 10's restrictions. Accusations of cheating immediately flooded server chat, reopening old wounds between rival factions.

### The Telegram Exploit and Administrative Crisis

On the fifth day of Season 10, the server's delicate peace shattered. During a casual TikTok livestream by [[WhoIsFishie]], [[FlameXode]] joined the chat and asked if his earlier attempts at exploiting the Telegram integration had been successful.

When [[WhoIsFishie]] replied that they hadn't worked, [[FlameXode]] proceeded to demonstrate the correct exploitation technique. It turned out [[WhoIsFishie]] had only performed one of the two steps needed to trigger the command injection. When [[FlameXode]] executed the full exploit, the server granted everyone online two shulker shells - items that should have been impossible to obtain in the season's progression.

Players online during the exploit included:
- [[Ssahan]] - 4 shells
- [[WhoIsFishie]] - 4 shells (burned)
- [[iBattus]] - 2 shells 
- [[yeetuz]] - 4 shells 
- [[invisble715|Pumkin715]] - 2 shells

[[WhoIsFishie]], broadcasting live to his audience, immediately destroyed his shells, declaring them "illegal contraband." The fate of the other shells remained uncertain, but suspicion fell heavily on [[WhoIsFishie]].


%% make correction it was [[shihaam_me]] who checked the enderchest %%

[[iBattus]], reinstated as an administrator for Season 10, seized the opportunity. Using his elevated permissions, he inspected [[WhoIsFishie]]'s ender chest, discovering what appeared to be an illegitimate shulker box.

![[fishie_echest.jpg]]

The evidence was posted in the SarCraft group chat, seemingly confirming [[WhoIsFishie]]'s guilt. Yet [[WhoIsFishie]] vehemently denied the accusations, claiming [[iBattus]] had planted the evidence to frame him and validate [[Ssahan]]'s earlier suspicions.

"_If I owned a shulker box, it would be red,_" [[WhoIsFishie]] insisted, referencing his well-documented preference for the color. [[shihaam_me]], in a rare moment of intervention, confirmed this quirk of [[WhoIsFishie]]'s character.

The controversy escalated further when [[WhoIsFishie]] accused [[iBattus]] of administrative abuse, inspecting his ender chest without proper authorization or a server court order.

In the chaos that followed, [[shihaam_me]] disabled Minecraft message forwarding to the Telegram group, preventing further exploitation of the vulnerability. Later that night, the server went offline as [[FlameXode]] attempted to deploy an emergency patch to fix the [[Exploits#Telegram Command Injection|Telegram Command Injection]] exploit once and for all.

The first week of Season 10 had delivered more drama, betrayal, and technical chaos than some entire seasons before it. And this was just the beginning. 

### The Audit

Server would be down till night of day 6  
and would return with the [[Udit]] plugin patched thus patching out any backdoors for the server. 

auditing plugins would be installed to check player inventory and ender chests

the following players would be questioned due to having items with mending 
- [[BuhKiru]]
- [[TheHarryG|12OK]]
- [[WhoIsFishie]]
- [[Anoojfunaid]]
- [[Perhaps]]

players would claim they got it through legal means

[[iBattus]] would then question [[Anoojfunaid]] about the [[Exploits#Illegal Items#Hacked Helmet]]

[[Anoojfunaid]], [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Buhkiru]] would get on a call where [[WhoIsFishie]] tell [[Buhkiru]] about the helmet situation

during this call [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Anoojfunaid]] would forget to mute their mic so [[shihaam_me]] heard part of what was said 

[[shihaam_me]] would over hear [[WhoIsFishie]] talking about hacks and incorrectly assume he was hacking 

this would lead to players getting banned
- [[WhoIsFishie]] : 1 count of hacking
- [[Anoojfunaid]] : 1 count of illegal items

[[Donut]] and [[TheHarryG|12OK]] would be appointed as lawyers for [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Anoojfunaid]]
the team would compile proof of [[WhoIsFishie]] not using clients as he was clean the entire season

[[athphane]] would be the judge over seeing the case with [[shihaam_me]] and [[iBattus]] being the prosecutor 

while this is happening [[shihaam_me]] and [[iBattus]] would go through server logs and discover even more sus things things leading to [[Perhaps]] getting banned for alleged flying and owning illegal items

```
Perhaps has Diamond Chestplate, Ender Chest, cokestone via cheat 
he also seems to use a flying hack

AnoojFunaid has Diamond Helmet via cheat
```

```
diamond_swordcustom_name='["",{"text":"cokestone","italic":false}]',enchantments={levels:{fire_aspect:1000,knockback:1000,looting:1000,mending:1,sharpness:1000,unbreaking:1000,vanishing_curse:1}}
```

the [[Chicken Factory]] would submit a case against the state

**Chicken Factory V The State** 

1. one count of illegal search and seizure and abuse of administrative power for [[shihaam_me]]. 
2. two counts of wiretapping for [[shihaam_me]]. 
3. one count of negligence for both [[iBattus]] and [[shihaam_me]]
