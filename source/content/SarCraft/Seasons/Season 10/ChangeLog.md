## Detailed Descriptions

### Progression Changes

#### No Ender Eyes

Crafting of ender eyes has been disabled, preventing access to the End dimension. This was implemented as [[WhoIsFishie]] couldn't code a proper way to disable the End. An unintended consequence is that ender chests are also disabled, making them rare treasures only found in jungle temple structures.

#### No Diamond Ore

All diamond ore generation has been replaced, forcing players to find diamonds through other means. This change is designed to slow down progression and extend the season's lifespan.

#### No Nether

The Nether dimension is inaccessible for the first two weeks of the season. Initially, the mod only disabled flint and steel from lighting portals, but players discovered they could use fire charges, lightning, or burning logs instead. The fix was to instantly kill any player who touches a nether portal during the restricted period.

#### No Villager Trading

Villager trading has been completely disabled to prevent players from obtaining diamond tools or mending books, which would circumvent other progression restrictions.

### Quality of Life

#### Graves

Upon death, a grave is created containing the player's items and 10% of their XP. All players can loot graves, adding a risk element to PvP encounters.

#### Tree Chopper

Breaking the bottom log of a tree with an axe will automatically fell the entire tree, making wood gathering more efficient.

#### Xaeros Map

A minimap mod that allows players to share locations and map the chunks they've explored. Maps can be exported as images for strategic planning.

#### Durability Ping

Players receive a notification when their tools or armor are about to break, preventing unexpected item loss.

#### Enchanting Storage

Lapis lazuli can now be stored inside enchanting tables, eliminating the need to carry it for each enchanting session.

### Content Additions

#### Dungeons and Taverns

New structures have been added to the world, containing valuable loot including diamonds and armor. These structures provide an alternative progression path since diamond ore is disabled.

#### Voice Chat

Integrated voice communication includes both proximity-based chat for nearby players and group calls for team coordination.

#### Pet Enhancements

Multiple modifications to pets:

- **Chested Companions** - Dogs can wear chests with 9 inventory slots (items not protected by grave mod if the dog dies)
- **Sleeping Dogs** - Dogs will go to sleep after sitting for an extended period
- **Fat Cats** - Resource pack that makes cats appear chonky
- **Better Horses** - Improved horse mechanics and abilities

### Balance Changes

#### Anvil Overhaul

With mending removed, anvils have been modified to allow unlimited repairs without increasing costs or refusing to repair heavily-used tools.

#### Small Blocks

Wandering traders now offer miniature versions of regular blocks, providing unique decorative options.

### Small Tweaks

- Enderman griefing has been disabled
- Crops won't break when players with Feather Falling enchantment jump on them
