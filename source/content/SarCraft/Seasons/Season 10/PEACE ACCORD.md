# THE SEASON 10 PEACE ACCORD

## FISHIE-iBATTUS ARMISTICE

_Enacted this 18th day of March, 2025_
### PREAMBLE

WHEREAS the parties known as **[[WhoIsFishie]]** and **[[iBattus]]** have engaged in numerous conflicts spanning multiple seasons of the SarCraft realm;

WHEREAS these conflicts have resulted in obsidian imprisonment, combat logging, courtroom bloodshed, and the tragic death of beloved pets;

WHEREAS both parties recognize that Season 10 represents an opportunity for renewal and prosperity;

NOW THEREFORE, the undersigned parties hereby establish this binding Peace Accord to govern interactions during Season 10 and potentially beyond.

### ARTICLE I: NON-AGGRESSION

1. Neither party shall engage in the deliberate destruction of the other's buildings, farms, infrastructure, or bases.
2. Neither party shall deploy TNT, lava, fire, withers, or other destructive mechanisms against the other's property.
3. Neither party shall engage in "griefing" as commonly defined within SarCraft customs, though the exact definition may be subject to interpretation.
4. The intentional killing of pets, particularly those with names, is strongly discouraged and may be considered a violation of this Accord, depending on circumstances and intent.

### ARTICLE II: TERRITORIAL CONSIDERATIONS

1. Each party agrees to generally respect what might reasonably be considered the other's territory.
2. A suitable distance of unspecified measurement should ideally exist between bases, unless circumstances dictate otherwise.

### ARTICLE III: DISPUTE RESOLUTION

1. In the event of a perceived violation of this Accord, the aggrieved party shall first seek peaceful resolution through direct communication.
2. If direct communication fails, the parties shall submit to arbitration by a mutually agreed-upon third party.
3. Trial by combat shall be considered a measure of absolute last resort.

### ARTICLE IV: EXCEPTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS

1. This Accord places no restrictions whatsoever on PvP combat between parties.
2. This Accord does not prevent either party from engaging in server politics, forming alliances, or competing economically.
3. This Accord does not prohibit the reporting of legitimately discovered rule violations to server administration.
4. Actions taken in "self-defense" are exempt from all provisions of this Accord, with each party reserving the right to determine what constitutes a threat requiring defensive measures.

### ARTICLE V: DURATION & TERMINATION

1. This Accord shall remain in effect for the duration of Season 10 unless formally terminated.
2. Formal termination requires a 72-hour written notice delivered via Telegram to the other party and to server administration.
3. Violations of this Accord do not automatically nullify it, but instead trigger the dispute resolution process outlined in Article III.

### ARTICLE VI: FACTION OBLIGATIONS

1. By signing this Accord, [[WhoIsFishie]] binds all current and future members of the [[Chicken Factory]] and any other faction under his leadership to abide by these terms.
2. Similarly, [[iBattus]] binds all current and future members of [[The Alliance]] and any faction under his leadership to adhere to this Accord.
3. Both parties acknowledge responsibility for the actions of their faction members and allies, and agree that violations committed by followers shall be treated as violations by the leaders themselves.
4. Neither party may claim ignorance of their faction members' actions as a defense against alleged violations of this Accord.
