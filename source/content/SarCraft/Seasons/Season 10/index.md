In the continuing saga of SarCraft history, Season 10 stands as a testament to both reconciliation and innovation. Before the season's launch, a significant amount of behind-the-scenes preparation took place, including a momentous peace agreement between longtime rivals [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]]. To prevent the infamous "2 week Minecraft phase" that had plagued previous seasons, gameplay changes were implemented to artificially slow player progression. [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]], in collaboration with [[iBattus]], developed mods that would fundamentally alter gameplay mechanics.

## Pre-Launch Developments

### February 4th - The White Flag

After seasons of bitter rivalry, [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]] reached a historic peace agreement, signaling a new era for the server. ![[fishie_ibattus_peace_agreement_chatlog.png]]

### February 5th - Charting a New Course

[[shihaam_me]] reactivated the group chat and initiated polls for changes to the new season. The proposed modifications included:

- Disable all villager trading [53:47]
- Disable diamond ore spawning [60:40]
- Disable Mending book [44:56]
- World size 10k [73:27]
- Disable Ender Chest [50:50]
- Proximity voice Mod [80:20]

### February 11th - Cracks in the Foundation

Tensions emerged when [[WhoIsFishie]] suggested a more seamless authentication plugin, which [[iBattus]] and [[shihaam_me]] rejected. The situation escalated when [[shihaam_me]] was quoted saying:

> Who cares about what [[WhoIsFishie]] wants

In response, [[WhoIsFishie]] created a poll to determine who actually cared about his input. ![[who cares what fishie wants poll results.png]]

Upon seeing the poll results favoring [[WhoIsFishie]], [[shihaam_me]] deleted all chat history related to the authentication plugin discussion. He later explained his opposition to seamless login was due to Microsoft deleting his account when he refused to migrate.

### February 12th - Broken Peace

The debate over authentication plugins continued, leading to the collapse of the truce between [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]]. ![[fishie vs ibattus over auth plugin chat log.png]]

### February 22nd - Reconciliation

A pivotal Telegram call took place with key players:

- [[iBattus]]
- [[WhoIsFishie]]
- [[shihaam_me]]
- [[Anoojfunaid]]
- [[Buhkiru]]
- [[athphane]]
- [[FlameXode]]

During this discussion, [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] attempted to convince [[athphane]] to support abandoning the Telegram-based authentication plugin responsible for the [[Exploits#Identity Theft]] vulnerability. After extensive negotiations, [[iBattus]] and [[shihaam_me]] agreed to switch to EasyAuth, and the peace between [[WhoIsFishie|Fishie]] and [[iBattus]] was restored.
## Mods and changes

## Week 1

### ToadGod's Quiet Return as ToadBlaze 

Season 10 witnessed the unexpected return of [[ToadGod]], a legendary figure from SarCraft's early history who hadn't been seen since the collapse of Season 3. His arrival under a new username `ToadBlaze` was notable primarily in the server logs rather than in the gameworld itself, with only veteran players recognizing the connection to the influential ToadGod of old. 

Unlike the revolutionary firebrand who once led server-wide votes and championed the [[Spawn Mason]]'s community ideals, ToadBlaze chose to keep a low profile in Season 10. Most current players knew neither his former nor current persona, recognizing his name only through server chronicles and old chat logs, if at all. 

The man who once deposed the [[Nazi]] leadership and inadvertently triggered the "Diamond Penis Incident" that ended Season 3 now kept largely to himself, avoiding the factional politics and server-wide drama that had become SarCraft's hallmark in his absence. Whether this reflected a change in his approach or simply caution in a server landscape that had evolved dramatically during his seven-season absence remained to be seen.
### The Four Corners Expedition

In a daring display of early-game exploration, [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Donut]] accomplished the seemingly impossible: visiting all four world borders in just three days. Supported by [[Chicken Factory]] members [[Klen04]] and [[Buhkiru]], the duo set out with carefully prepared diamond gear and a strategic plan.

#### The Journey

- **Day 1**: Extensive resource gathering and preparation
- **Day 2**:
    - Reached Northern Border (z:-10000)
    - Marked with a sign (accidentally misdated as "20-March")
    - Proceeded to Eastern Border (x:10000)
- **Day 3**:
    - Conquered Western Border (x:-10000)
    - Reached Southern Border (z:10000)
    - Brought along dogs with storage chests, leading to comical rescue missions

#### Challenges

The expedition wasn't without its hurdles. Wandering dogs, treacherous terrain, and the sheer scale of the journey tested the explorers' resolve. Yet, [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Donut]] persevered, successfully mapping over 80,000 blocks of terrain.
