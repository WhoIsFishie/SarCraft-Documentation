## The Landmark Trial of Season 10

In the wake of a server-wide controversy involving the banning of [[WhoIsFishie]], [[Anoojfunaid]], and [[Perhaps]], a formal trial was convened to determine their guilt and appropriate punishments. This trial would become one of the most significant judicial proceedings in SarCraft history, revealing deep divisions between server administration and the powerful [[Chicken Factory]] faction.

## Legal Teams

**Prosecution (The State):**

- [[shihaam_me]] - Server Owner
- [[iBattus]] - Administrator

**Defense (Chicken Factory):**

- [[Donut]] - Lead Counsel for [[WhoIsFishie]]
- [[Buhkiru]] - Counsel for [[Perhaps]] and [[Anoojfunaid]]
- [[TheHarryG|12OK]] - Supporting Counsel

**Presiding Judge:**

- [[athphane]] - Renowned for his previous judicial role in the [[Season 8#The Trial of the Century|Fish Bundy Trials]]

> [!NOTE] For a complete list of evidence submitted by both sides, see [[Evidence Catalog]]


## Charges and Trials

### [[WhoIsFishie]]'s Charges
#### 1. Illegal Possession of Shulker Box
on the ground of [[WhoIsFishie]] holding in a shulker box charge has been reduced to a simple possession charge as eye witness of the accounts is not concrete enough 

**Eye witnesses
- [[Ssahan]]
- [[yeetuz]]

**Verdicts by the judge
- [[WhoIsFishie]] is required to pay the judge 6 diamonds 
- [[WhoIsFishie]] is on the spectrum and needs help
- [[WhoIsFishie]] is flexing concrete 
- eyewitness claims are thrown out of court
- admins tampered with evidence by deleting the shulker found in [[WhoIsFishie]]'s ender chest

#### 2. Unauthorized Server Operator Status

**Evidence:** [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit I - WhoIsFishie Made Op|Exhibit I]]

**Key Exchanges:**

> **[[Buhkiru]]:** "It was someone else who gave [[WhoIsFishie]] OP."

> **[[WhoIsFishie]]:** "I had no idea how I got admin."

**Result:** OP charges dropped, no punishment given.
#### 3. Use of Hacked Clients

The state formally dropped these charges against [[WhoIsFishie]].
### [[Anoojfunaid]]'s Charges

#### 1. Possession of Illegal Items & Use of Exploits

**Evidence:**

- [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit P - Anooj's Hacked Helmet|Exhibit P]]
- [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit B - Recording of Anooj|Exhibit B]]
- [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit U - Admin Evidence of Hacked Helmet|Exhibit U]]

**[[Anoojfunaid]]** admitted to cheating charges, and [[Chicken Factory]] went into recess to discuss a plea deal.

Initially, [[TheHarryG|12OK]] bungled the defense:

> **[[TheHarryG|12OK]]:** _[speaking for [[Anoojfunaid]]]_ "He's an idiot and admits to the crimes he committed." _[but forgets to make an actual plea deal with the judge]_

After a second recess, [[Buhkiru]] presented a formal plea:

> **[[Buhkiru]]:** Your Honor, on behalf of my client, [[Anoojfunaid]], I would like to formally request a plea deal. My client recognizes the seriousness of the charges against him and understands the impact of his actions on the server community. However, we believe that a more lenient outcome would be in the best interest of justice, given the following points:
>
>1. Lack of Malicious Intent: While [[Anoojfunaid]] did use the exploited items, it was done without malicious intent or an understanding of the full consequences. [[Anoojfunaid]] did not engage in the exploitation with the intention of disrupting gameplay or gaining unfair advantages. Rather, this was a misunderstanding of the situation, possibly due to unclear server rules or a lack of awareness regarding the hack.
>
>1. First-Time Offender: [[Anoojfunaid]] has no history of prior offenses on the server and has been an active and positive member up until this incident. He has learned from this experience and is committed to upholding the integrity of the server moving forward.
>
>1. Willingness to Cooperate: [[Anoojfunaid]] has shown a willingness to cooperate with the investigation, providing full transparency and answering questions regarding his actions. He understands the severity of his actions and is ready to work with the administrators to avoid such incidents in the future.
>
>In light of these factors, we respectfully request that the court consider a plea deal, which would allow for a reduced sentence or penalty in exchange for [[Anoojfunaid]]’s commitment to following the server’s rules and contributing positively moving forward. We believe that a fair resolution can be reached that not only addresses the violation but also encourages rehabilitation and continued contribution to the community.
>
>Thank you, Your Honor, for considering this request.

**Result:** [[iBattus]] accepted the plea deal, giving [[Anoojfunaid]] a 2-day ban in exchange for the return of the helmet.
### [[Perhaps]]'s charges

#### 1. Flying Charges

**Evidence:** [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit A - Evidence of Perhaps Flying|Exhibit A]]

**Key Exchanges:**

> **[[Perhaps]]:** "It's not my fault that [[shihaam_me]] has a shitty server. I am barely moving right now and I got kicked out 21 times and now imagine me going on a boat."

> **[[Perhaps]]:** _[noting that server logs said he was "floating for too long" on a boat, not flying]_

> **[[iBattus]]:** "The logs do not mention he was caught flying in a boat. If a player is flying on a boat, it would say so in the logs."

> **[[athphane]]:** "I also run my own Minecraft server. I also know that this particular line pertains to fly hacks. The argument for a vessel floating is not applicable because Minecraft console will clearly tell you if it's a boat or a horse. If the horse is named, it will also tell you what the name of the horse is as well, so yeah, guilty for flying."

**Result:** [[Perhaps]] found guilty of flying. If caught again, a 4-day ban per play session would be applied.

> **[[Perhaps]]:** "It's not fair."

> **[[Perhaps]]:** _[requests 6 diamonds every time the server lags for him]_

> **[[athphane]]:** _[rejects this request]_

#### 2. Illegal Items Charges

**Evidence:**

- [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit L - Perhaps' Ender Chest|Exhibit L]]
- [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit N - Perhaps' Guardian Eggs|Exhibit N]]
- [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit M - Perhaps' Multiple Ender Chests|Exhibit M]]
- [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit K - Perhaps' Hacked Weapon|Exhibit K]]

The case took an unexpected turn when discussing evidence dates:

> **[[Buhkiru]]:** "Can you tell the court the date of this event?"

> **[[iBattus]]:** "On the evidence I wrote **5th February**, carry on."

> **[[Buhkiru]]:** "**5th February**?"

> **[[iBattus]]:** "Yup. If you check the evidence you will see it. The evidence I provided will have the date."

> **[[Buhkiru]]:** "Can you repeat the data again. You said **5th February**?"

> **[[iBattus]]:** "Yeah."

> **[[Buhkiru]]:** "Your honor, I'd like to say the server started on **28th February**."

> **[[iBattus]]:** "No I didn't say February, I said March. You can check the recordings. I said March."

> **[[Buhkiru]]:** "I asked you if you said 5th February and you said yes. I confirmed with you."

> **[[iBattus]]:** "Go and check the evidence I provided. Please refer to the evidence and come back. You call yourself a lawyer?"

> **[[shihaam_me]]:** "[[iBattus]], you said 5th February in the evidence locker."

> **[[iBattus]]:** "Check again, I said March, check again."

> **[[shihaam_me]]:** "I'm checking and it says February twice. I checked the logs and it is March but you said it's February."

> **[[WhoIsFishie]]:** _[taking the opportunity to point out that [[iBattus]] is showing a pattern of mishandling evidence]_

> **[[iBattus]]:** _[claimed he was fasting when he wrote the date submitted to evidence]_

> **[[WhoIsFishie]]:** _[asks if he was fasting when he responded to [[Buhkiru]]'s questions]_

Regarding the illegal items themselves:

> **[[iBattus]]:** "The logs don't lie."

> **[[Perhaps]]:** "But you're a liar."

> **[[iBattus]]:** "That's why I'm quoting the server logs."

> **[[Buhkiru]]:** "It was not [[Perhaps]] who spawned the items in. He burned the items he got."

> **[[Perhaps]]:** "I don't have shit on me man, you can check my chests, you can check my ender chest, you can check my inventory. All my items are legit man."

> **[[iBattus]]:** "All your items are not legit."

> **[[Perhaps]]:** "All my items are legit."

> **[[iBattus]]:** "Your sword has the same name, it's not legit."

> **[[Perhaps]]:** "My sword is legit. You wanna transport me to the actual world and check my sword? Wanna check my inventory when I spawn in?"

> **[[iBattus]]:** "The logs says you have the sword with the name 'cockstone'."

> **[[Buhkiru]]:** "He can't return anything he doesn't have. He burned all the illegals he was given. He didn't want illegal items."

> **[[athphane]]:** "Okay, why did you burn them?"

> **[[Buhkiru]]:** "He didn't want any illegal items."

> **[[Perhaps]]:** "I'm a legit player."

> **[[iBattus]]:** "I don't believe he would burn all the illegals."

> **[[athphane]]:** "Okay, what will you ([[iBattus]]) accept?"

> **[[iBattus]]:** "I just want the items back."

> **[[iBattus]]:** "Okay, he says he burned them, so if we see it in the wild, can we ban him forever?"

> **[[athphane]]:** "Yes."

**Result:** [[iBattus]] requested a court order to monitor [[Perhaps]], which [[athphane]] granted.

### Chicken Factory's Mending Controversy

The prosecution raised concerns about [[Chicken Factory]] members possessing items with mending enchantments.
**Key Exchanges:**

> **[[Buhkiru]]:** _[demonstrates how they used a hopper to transfer mending books to anvils to enchant items]_

> **[[iBattus]]:** "My concern is not how mending was applied to the items but how the members of Chicken Factory got enough mending books."

> **[[Buhkiru]]:** "I got mending pants and tools from the Deep Dark."

> **[[WhoIsFishie]]:** "Not all Chicken Factory players have mending, only the most active players."

> **[[iBattus]]:** "It doesn't make sense."

> **[[WhoIsFishie]]:** "The judge decides that."

> **[[iBattus]]:** "No one else on the server has mending even though [[The Alliance]] has been looting structures."

> **[[WhoIsFishie]]:** "Before the server started, we checked the mod packs installed on the server and found where mending would spawn, so our methods are much more efficient than your methods of checking random structures you see."

> **[[Buhkiru]]:** "I was on the test server checking the structures."

> **[[iBattus]]:** "I don't believe it."

> **[[athphane]]:** "I am willing to believe it. I don't know man, you guys said you research and your methods are efficient, which they are—I applaud you for it—but it's kinda gay considering there are other players playing and you guys have OP gear."

> **[[iBattus]]:** "They have mending on everything and I haven't even seen a mending book."

> **[[WhoIsFishie]]:** _[makes an offer]_ "Drop the mending charges and the Chicken Factory will disclose a structure that 100% spawns mending books."

> **[[ToadGod|ToadBlaze]]:** _[in chat backing up [[Chicken Factory]]]_ "I also researched the mod pack and it's possible to get mending on day 1 if you explore enough."

> **[[Perhaps]]:** _[in chat]_ "We are being on trial for [[iBattus]] being bad at Minecraft."

> **[[shihaam_me]]:** "This whole thing sounds like an [[iBattus]] skill issue."

> **[[iBattus]]:** "I'll respect whatever [[athphane]] decides."

> **[[athphane]]:** _[says he wants a full set of mending diamond armor]_

> **[[WhoIsFishie]]:** "We can get it for you in a week."

> **[[athphane]]:** "[[Chicken Factory]] has to deliver within a week."


## Final Judgments

- **[[WhoIsFishie]]:** Cleared of all charges, required to pay 6 diamonds to the court
- **[[Anoojfunaid]]:** Guilty on all charges, banned for 2 days with conditions for return
- **[[Perhaps]]:** Not guilty of item spawning but guilty of flying, placed under court monitoring
- **[[Chicken Factory]]:** Required to deliver mending gear and diamonds to Judge [[athphane]]


## TL;DR Summary

- **The Date Fiasco:** [[iBattus]] submitted evidence incorrectly dated February 5th when the server started February 28th, severely damaging prosecution credibility.
- **Shulker Box Drama:** What [[iBattus]] claimed was an illegal shulker box in [[WhoIsFishie]]'s ender chest was ruled to be purple concrete.
- **The Helmet Plea:** [[Anoojfunaid]] admitted to having an illegal helmet and got a reduced 2-day ban through a plea deal.
- **Flight Allowance:** [[Perhaps]] was found guilty of flying but given a unique punishment: one free flight every 4 days.
- **Burned Evidence:** [[Perhaps]] claimed he burned all illegal items given to him. Court ruled he'd be permanently banned if these items reappeared.
- **Mending Mystery:** [[Chicken Factory]] revealed they had researched structure loot tables before the server launched, allowing them to efficiently target mending books while other factions wandered randomly.
- **Skill Issue:** Even [[shihaam_me]] sided with defendants at points, describing [[iBattus]]'s inability to find mending as a "skill issue."
- **Judicial Profits:** Judge [[athphane]] ended the trial significantly richer, with diamonds and a promised set of mending armor.
