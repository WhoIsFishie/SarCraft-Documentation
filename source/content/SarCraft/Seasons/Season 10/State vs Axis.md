![[admin_finds_hacked_helmet_beloning_to_anooj.jpg]]

[[Anoojfunaid]] using hacks scripts and exploits, ownership of hacked helmet 
[[Anoojfunaid]] admits to cheating charges
[[Chicken Factory]] would go into recess to discuses a plea deal for [[Anoojfunaid]]
[[TheHarryG|12OK]] would speak for [[Anoojfunaid]] and call him and idiot and admit to crimes [[Anoojfunaid]] committed but would forget to make a plea deal with the judge

[[Chicken Factory]] would go into recess to discuses a plea deal for [[Anoojfunaid]] again

[[Buhkiru]] would come as the new judge for [[Anoojfunaid]]

statement by [[Buhkiru]]
>Your Honor, on behalf of my client, [[Anoojfunaid]], I would like to formally request a plea deal. My client recognizes the seriousness of the charges against him and understands the impact of his actions on the server community. However, we believe that a more lenient outcome would be in the best interest of justice, given the following points:
>
>1. Lack of Malicious Intent: While [[Anoojfunaid]] did use the exploited items, it was done without malicious intent or an understanding of the full consequences. [[Anoojfunaid]] did not engage in the exploitation with the intention of disrupting gameplay or gaining unfair advantages. Rather, this was a misunderstanding of the situation, possibly due to unclear server rules or a lack of awareness regarding the hack.
>
>1. First-Time Offender: [[Anoojfunaid]] has no history of prior offenses on the server and has been an active and positive member up until this incident. He has learned from this experience and is committed to upholding the integrity of the server moving forward.
>
>1. Willingness to Cooperate: [[Anoojfunaid]] has shown a willingness to cooperate with the investigation, providing full transparency and answering questions regarding his actions. He understands the severity of his actions and is ready to work with the administrators to avoid such incidents in the future.
>
>In light of these factors, we respectfully request that the court consider a plea deal, which would allow for a reduced sentence or penalty in exchange for [[Anoojfunaid]]’s commitment to following the server’s rules and contributing positively moving forward. We believe that a fair resolution can be reached that not only addresses the violation but also encourages rehabilitation and continued contribution to the community.
>
>Thank you, Your Honor, for considering this request.

[[iBattus]] would accept the plea deal for the [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit P - Anooj's Hacked Helmet]]

[[Anoojfunaid]] would be given a 2 day ban in exchange of the return of the helmet.


### [[Perhaps]]'s charges

- [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit L - Perhaps' Ender Chest]]
- [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit K - Perhaps' Hacked Weapon]]
- [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit N - Perhaps' Guardian Eggs]]
- [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit M - Perhaps' Multiple Ender Chests]]
- [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit A - Evidence of Perhaps Flying]]

#### Hacked Weapon charges

[[Buhkiru]] would question [[iBattus]] about [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit K - Perhaps' Hacked Weapon]]. 

- [[Buhkiru]] : can you tell the court the date of this event.
- [[iBattus]] : on the evidence i wrote **5th February**, carry on.
- [[Buhkiru]] : **5th February**?
- [[iBattus]] : yup. if you check the evidence you will see it. the evidence i provided will have the date
- [[Buhkiru]] : can you repeat the data again. you said **5th February**?
- [[iBattus]] : yeah. 
- [[Buhkiru]] : your honor id like to say the server started on **28th February**. 
- [[iBattus]] : no i didn't say February I said March. you can check the recordings. i said march
- [[Buhkiru]] : i asked you if you said 5th February and you said yes. i confirmed with you.
- [[iBattus]] : go and check the evidence i provided. please refer to the evidence and come back. you call yourself a lawyer?
- [[shihaam_me]] : [[iBattus]] you said 5th February in the evidence locker
- [[iBattus]] : check again i said march, check again
- [[shihaam_me]] : I'm checking and it says February twice, i checked the logs and it is march but you said its February 

[[WhoIsFishie]] would take this opportunity to point out that [[iBattus]] is showing a pattern of mishandling evidence 

[[iBattus]] said he was fasting when he wrote the date that was submitted to evidence for the court case 

[[WhoIsFishie]] asks if he was fasting when he responded to [[Buhkiru]]'s questions 

[[shihaam_me]] would link to [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit K - Perhaps' Hacked Weapon]] showing it says 5th February 

[[shihaam_me]] says even if the date is wrong he saw the items in [[Perhaps]]'s inventory. he would retract this statement right away 

[[Buhkiru]] would request the charge be dismissed due to lack of evidence 
[[athphane]] the judge would claim that the evidence is wrong 
[[Perhaps]] claims this is a mistrial and he's innocent 

#### Flying charges

the court would move on to [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit A - Evidence of Perhaps Flying]]

[[Perhaps]] : its not my fault that [[shihaam_me]] has a shitty server. i am barely moving right now and i got kicked out 21 times and now imagine me going on a boat

[[Perhaps]] would also note that the server logs said that he was floating for too long on a boat and not that he was flying

[[iBattus]] would note that [[Perhaps]] logs does not mention that he was caught flying in a boat. if a player is flying on a boat it would say so in the logs

[[athphane]] would reference [nothacking](https://t.me/c/2251060085/30) link that was submitted to the evidance locker by [[shihaam_me]]

[[iBattus]] would note that [[Perhaps]] is also caught moving too fast on a 'Cherry Boat'

[[Buhkiru]] would request the judge decide.

[[athphane]] : i also run my own Minecraft server. i also know that this particular line pertains to fly hacks. the argument for a vessle was floating is not applicable becuase minecraft console will clearly tell you if its a boat or a horse if the horse is named it will also tell you what the name of the horse is as well so yeah guilty for flying 

if [[Perhaps]] is caught flying again in the logs [[Buhkiru]] suggests a week ban

[[Perhaps]] says its not fair

[[athphane]] says for every time he's caught flying again he will get 4 day ban 
the ban is per play session and not per log line

basically allowing [[Perhaps]] to fly once every 4 days 

[[Perhaps]] requests 6 diamonds every time the server lags for him
[[athphane]] rejects this

#### Illegal Item Charges

- [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit L - Perhaps' Ender Chest]]
- [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit N - Perhaps' Guardian Eggs]]
- [[Evidence Catalog#Exhibit M - Perhaps' Multiple Ender Chests]]

[[iBattus]] offers [[Perhaps]] an unban if he returns all the illegal items 

[[Perhaps]] claims he didn't spawn them he merely was the recipient of the items 

 - [[iBattus]] : the logs dont lie
 - [[Perhaps]] : but youre a lier
 - [[iBattus]] : thats why im quoting the server logs
 - [[Buhkiru]] : it was not [[Perhaps]] who spawned the items in. he burned the items he got
 - [[Perhaps]] : i dont have shit on me man, you can check my chests you can check my echest you can check my inventory. all my items are legit man
 - [[iBattus]] : all your items are not legit 
 - [[Perhaps]] : all my items are legit
 - [[iBattus]] : your sword has the same name its not legit
 - [[Perhaps]] : my sword is legit. you wanna transport me to the actual world and check my sword? wanna check my inventory when i spawn in?
 - [[iBattus]] : the logs says you have the sword with the name `cockstone`
 - [[Buhkiru]] : he cant return anything he doesn't have. he burned all the illegals he was given. he didn't want illegal items 
 - [[athphane]] : okay why did you burn them?
 - [[Buhkiru]] : he didnt want any illegal items
 - [[Perhaps]] : im a legit player 
 - [[iBattus]] : i dont belive he would burn all the illegals 
 - [[athphane]] : ok what will you([[iBattus]]) accept
 - [[iBattus]] : i just want the items back
 - [[iBattus]] : okay he says he burned them so if we see it in the wild can we ban him forever?
 - [[athphane]] : yes


[[iBattus]] would request for a court order to monitor [[Perhaps]]
[[athphane]] would grant the court order 
### [[Chicken Factory]] charged with ownership of mending 

after discussion the [[Chicken Factory]] would reveal one of their methods of obtaining mending 

[[Buhkiru]] would show to the court how they used a hopper to transfer mending book to an anvil to give a sword mending enchantment 

[[iBattus]] says his concern is not how mending was applied to the items but how the members of chicken factory got enough mending books to 

[[Buhkiru]] would claim he got mending pants and tools from deep dark

[[WhoIsFishie]] would note that not all chicken factory players has mending and only the most active players 

[[iBattus]] says it doesn't make sense

[[WhoIsFishie]] says the judge decides that

[[iBattus]] says no one else on the server has mending even tho [[The Alliance]] has been looting structures 

[[WhoIsFishie]] : before the server started we checked the mod packs that's installed on the server and found where mending would spawn so our methods are much more efficient then your methods of checking random structures you see

[[Buhkiru]] : i was on the test server checking the structures

[[iBattus]] : i don't believe it

[[athphane]] : i am willing to believe it. idk man you guys said you research and your method are efficient which they are i applaud you for it but its kinda gay considering there is other players playing and you guys have OP gear

[[iBattus]] : they have mending on everything and i haven't even seen a mending book

[[WhoIsFishie]] makes an offer to [[iBattus]]
- drop the mending charges and the chicken factory will disclose a structure that 100% spawns mending book

[[ToadGod|ToadBlaze]] in the chat would backup the claims of the [[Chicken Factory]] saying he also researched the mod pack and its possible to get mending on day 1 if you explore enough 

[[Perhaps]] in the chat would say "we are being on trial for [[iBattus]] being bad at Minecraft"

[[shihaam_me]] : this whole thing sounds like a [[iBattus]] skill issue

[[iBattus]] : ill respect whatever [[athphane]] decides 

[[athphane]] says he wants a full set of mending diamond armor 

[[WhoIsFishie]] : we can get it for you in a week 

[[athphane]] : [[Chicken Factory]] has to deliver with a week


### Final Conclusion 

[[WhoIsFishie]] clear of all charges
[[Anoojfunaid]] guilty of all charges and unban after 2a days
[[Perhaps]] not guilty but under a court order 

[[athphane]] is to receive mending gear and diamonds
