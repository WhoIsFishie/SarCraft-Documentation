#### Exhibit R

```
Recently, two of our regular players noticed something unusual - another player with items that aren't supposed to be in our gameplay. They thoughtfully brought this to our admin team's attention.

While our server was temporarily offline, our admin team looked into the situation. After checking the player's inventory and reviewing server logs, we found several instances where unauthorized items had appeared.

Once the server was back online, we did a routine inventory check of all players and opened a conversation in our Telegram group to understand what happened. Though the players in question initially didn't acknowledge the situation, they joined the server shortly after.

During admin observation, we overheard some unintentional admissions through an open microphone, and noticed attempts to conceal the unauthorized items in storage containers.

To maintain a fair and enjoyable environment for everyone, we made the difficult decision to issue bans to the players involved.

We appreciate everyone's understanding and continued support in keeping our community fun and fair for all players!
