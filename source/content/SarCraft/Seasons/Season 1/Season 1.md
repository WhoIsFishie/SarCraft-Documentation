> the portal and the animal pens were added by other players who took refuge in the sarcube before leaving spawn

after some time on the server [[Redacted]] invites [[shihaam_me]] over to his base.

during this time on the server a lot of new players are invited on and factions start to form.
- The [[Weebs]]
- [[Holy Knights of the Templars|CHSE]]
- [[Nazi]]
 
most of these factions didnt have anymore then 3 players

Season is known to be one of the most peaceful seasons so far with all factions living in close proximity to each other and there being no wars
