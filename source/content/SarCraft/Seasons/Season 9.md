Code_Name : iBattus's revenge

In the long and storied history of SarCraft, few chapters stand as dramatically intense as Season 9 - a period that would come to be known as "**iBattus's Revenge**." What began as a seemingly peaceful vanilla server would transform into a battleground of strategic warfare, calculated betrayals, and perhaps the most satisfying revenge ever witnessed in SarCraft history.

## The Aftermath of Fish Bundy

When Season 9 launched in early 2024, the server still lived in the shadow of the infamous "[[Season 8|Fish Bundy Trials]]." After finally achieving his long-sought victory over [[iBattus]] in the chaotic courthouse massacre, [[WhoIsFishie]] seemed to have lost his taste for bloodshed. The killer who had terrorized Season 8 declared himself reformed - a pacifist ready to build rather than destroy.

Veterans of previous seasons were skeptical - and rightfully so. For behind this faÃ§ade of peace, something far more insidious was brewing. [[iBattus]], humiliated not once but twice in Season 8, had spent the intervening months plotting his revenge. The courthouse deaths hadn't ended their rivalry - they had merely transformed it into something darker, more calculated, and infinitely more dangerous.
## Main Players


| Fishie Land     | [[The Alliance]] |     |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --- |
| [[WhoIsFishie]] | [[iBattus]]      |     |
| [[Nausham]]     | [[Ssahan]]       |     |
| [[Anoojfunaid]] |                  |     |

The once-mighty [[Chicken Factory]] remained officially retired, with its most active members forming the new [[Fishie Land]] faction. Meanwhile, [[iBattus]], still bearing the psychological scars of humiliations from previous seasons, formed a smaller but determined alliance with newcomer [[Ssahan]] - a player whose skills would prove instrumental in the coming conflict.

## The Great War of Season 9: iBattus's Revenge

### Founding of Fishie Land 

In what appeared to be an innocuous land claim, [[WhoIsFishie]] staked his territory on an island directly in front of spawn - a strategic position that would allow him to monitor all new players entering the world.

What seemed like a simple territorial declaration was actually the first move in a calculated game of chess. [[WhoIsFishie]] began a massive deforestation project, clearing every tree from the island - not for resources, but to establish unobstructed sightlines across his domain. The one flaw in this master plan? The abundance of trees everywhere else on the server rendered this tactical advantage almost meaningless.

The early days on the server were peaceful with no fights. [[Anoojfunaid]] and [[Nausham]] would join [[WhoIsFishie]] at [[Fishie Land]], creating a power base that eerily resembled the dominance of the [[Chicken Factory]] in previous seasons.

All the while, [[iBattus]] watched from the shadows, studying patterns, cataloging weaknesses, and biding his time. The humiliation of the courtroom still burned fresh in his memory.
### Raid of the end

In a classic SarCraft power play, the [[Fishie Land]] crew executed a flawlessly coordinated speedrun of the End dimension. Their prize? The coveted Dragon Egg - the ultimate symbol of dominance in the Minecraft universe.

Not to be outdone, [[iBattus]] and his ally soon followed, looting what remaining treasures they could from the End. But the damage was done - [[Fishie Land]] had secured the most prestigious trophy.


### Seed of [[iBattus]]
The first major conflict erupted when [[iBattus]] innocently posted a screenshot of a village he had discovered:

![[bassam_ss.jpg]]

Days later, [[WhoIsFishie]] posted his own screenshot of the exact same village from an identical angle:

![[fishie_ss.jpg]]

This seemingly impossible coincidence led to explosive accusations. How could [[WhoIsFishie]] have found the exact same location without coordinates? The answer seemed clear to [[iBattus]] - his nemesis had somehow obtained the server's world seed, allowing him to locate any structure with precision.

![[Pasted image 20250226092837.png]]   

[[WhoIsFishie]] maintained his innocence, but the evidence was damning - especially considering the server was down at the time the screenshot was allegedly taken.

In a desperate attempt to prove his accusations, [[iBattus]] meticulously analyzed the metadata of the screenshots, searching for timestamps that would expose [[WhoIsFishie]]'s deception. The controversy grew so heated that [[shihaam_me]], the server's notoriously hands-off admin, was called to render judgment.

![[Pasted image 20250226093024.png]]   

His verdict was dismissive: "Fishie doesn't have seed, Bassam is delusional."

The ruling only deepened [[iBattus]]'s resentment, adding fuel to a smoldering rivalry.

### Rage of [[Buhkiru]]

[[Fishie Land]]'s strict anti-trespassing policies were soon put to the test when [[Buhkiru]] wandered too close to their territory. What followed was not a simple warning, but a coordinated stalking operation.

The [[Fishie Land]] crew tracked [[Buhkiru]] through the Nether dimension for hours, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. When he finally stepped through a portal, they pounced in a 2-vs-1 ambush that left the player so frustrated he rage-quit the server entirely.

The message was clear: [[Fishie Land]]'s rules were to be taken seriously.

For [[iBattus]], watching from afar through server chat, this incident was not merely about territorial enforcement - it was further proof of [[WhoIsFishie]]'s continued malice despite claims of pacifism. The "reformed" Fish Bundy was still claiming victims, just with different justifications.
### [[Mika]] Reincarnation 

In the midst of growing tensions, a poignant subplot emerged - the story of [[Mika]], a pet whose fate would become inextricably tied to the server's greatest conflict.

For [[iBattus]], observing through reconnaissance, the axolotl represented something else entirely - a vulnerability, a pressure point that could be exploited at the perfect moment.
### The Great War Begins

The powder keg of conflict finally exploded when [[Ssahan]] was caught spying on [[Fishie Land]]. A frantic chase ensued, ending only when [[Ssahan]] committed the cardinal SarCraft sin - combat logging to avoid death.

Hours later, [[Ssahan]] was spotted once again trespassing on [[Fishie Land]] territory. Though temporarily trapped by [[WhoIsFishie]]'s crew, he managed another miraculous escape.

What the [[Fishie Land]] faction didn't realize was that these weren't failed espionage attempts - they were calculated distractions orchestrated by [[iBattus]]. Each "failed" spy mission provided crucial intelligence about [[Fishie Land]]'s defenses, response times, and tactical weaknesses.

Determined to end the threat once and for all, the [[Fishie Land]] faction embarked on a reconnaissance mission to locate [[iBattus]]'s base. In a stroke of incredible timing, [[iBattus]] logged in while they were exploring his territory.

But this wasn't luck - it was bait. [[iBattus]] had been monitoring server traffic, waiting for this exact moment. As the [[Fishie Land]] forces converged on his position, [[Ssahan]] executed the first phase of their master plan.

While [[iBattus]] was getting jumped, appearing to desperately combat log and flee, [[Ssahan]] infiltrated the now-empty [[Fishie Land]] and detonated pre-placed TNT charges throughout the compound, obliterating all of their farms and infrastructure.

The timing was impeccable - a counter-strike executed at the precise moment when all defenders were absent. This wasn't merely revenge; it was strategic brilliance. [[iBattus]] had studied [[WhoIsFishie]]'s patterns across multiple seasons and knew exactly how he would respond to the bait.

As [[WhoIsFishie]] and his crew returned to find their paradise in ruins. The situation grew so desperate that [[Kuruzu_]] logged in briefly to assist in the assault.

The destruction of [[Fishie Land]]'s agricultural foundation demanded retaliation. [[WhoIsFishie]], abandoning all pretense of pacifism, launched a scorched earth campaign against [[iBattus]]'s base. TNT was just the beginning - lava cascades turned the once-proud structure into a smoldering ruin:

![[2024-03-30_21.11.44.png]]     
![[2024-03-30_21.16.25.png]]

Meanwhile, [[iBattus]] continued his systematic destruction of [[Fishie Land]], and in perhaps the most emotionally devastating attack of the war, killed [[Mika]] - an act of cruelty that crossed an unspoken line.

This wasn't a random act of violence - it was the culmination of psychological warfare. [[iBattus]] had observed the emotional significance of the pet and recognized its value as a target. In one calculated strike, he had inflicted a wound more painful than any amount of TNT or lava could achieve.

### The Final Confrontation

The culmination of hostilities took place on the scarred grounds of [[Fishie Land]]. [[iBattus]] and [[Ssahan]] launched what they hoped would be a decisive assault, but as the battle raged on, their armor began to fail.

Outmatched and outgeared, the duo retreated with the [[Fishie Land]] forces in hot pursuit. In a surprising turn, [[Ssahan]] called for peace:

![[peace.jpg]]    

But for [[Anoojfunaid]], the death of [[Mika]] could not go unanswered. In direct defiance [[Ssahan]] call for ceasefire, he continued the chase, eventually cornering and eliminating [[Ssahan]]


![[death of sshan.jpg]]    
With this final blow, [[Fishie Land]] claimed victory. [[iBattus]], refusing to acknowledge defeat, never logged into the server again, effectively ending Season 9.

In a final act of defiance, [[iBattus]] claimed moral victory, insisting he had accomplished his true objective - the destruction of [[Fishie Land]]. But the evidence suggested otherwise:

![[fishieland_rebuilt.png]]    
Rising from the ashes of destruction, [[Fishie Land]] was rebuilt stronger than before - a testament to the resilience of its faction and the ultimate failure of [[iBattus]]'s revenge.

Perhaps [[iBattus]]'s revenge had succeeded after all, not in destroying [[Fishie Land]] permanently, but in forever altering the sense of security and superiority that had defined [[WhoIsFishie]]'s reign for so many seasons.

## End of Season 9
And so another chapter in the tumultuous history of SarCraft came to a close - not with a server reset or administrative intervention, but with the silent absence of a player who had executed perhaps the most elaborate revenge plot in server history.

The legacy of Season 9 would echo through future seasons - a reminder that on SarCraft, grudges never truly die, they merely smolder until the next opportunity for vengeance presents itself.
