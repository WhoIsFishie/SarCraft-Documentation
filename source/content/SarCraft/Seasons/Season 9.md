these are the main players of the season with the majority of the Lore focusing around these 2 factions. [[Chicken Factory]] is still retired with most players being in active a new sub faction forms named [[Fishie Land]]

## The Story
### Founding of Fishie Land 
[[WhoIsFishie]] claims the island right Infront of spawn as his own island and tells the rest of the players to not step foot on his land  
![[fishieland_map.png]]

this was a large scale project where [[WhoIsFishie]] would clear out all the trees on the island. the point of this was to incontinence new players except the huge flaw in this plan was the fact that there were trees everywhere 

the early days on the server was peaceful with no fights. [[Anoojfunaid]] and [[Nausham]] would join [[WhoIsFishie]] at [[Fishie Land]]

### Raid of the end
[[Fishie Land]] crew would speedrun and raid the end to collect the egg  
[[iBattus]] and his crew would later visit the end to loot items shortly after this   

### Seed of [[iBattus]]
[[iBattus]] would post a screenshot of a village he was in and [[WhoIsFishie]] would go to the same village and post a screenshot of it. leading to [[iBattus]] accusing [[WhoIsFishie]] of having the seed for the server

### Rage of [[Buhkiru]]
[[Fishie Land]] has strict laws on trespassing which would lead to anyone doing so getting attacked. the crew would follow [[Buhkiru]] for a long time in the nether to find his base and would jump him once he goes through the portal. this would lead to [[Buhkiru]] rage quiting the server 

### [[Mika]] Reincarnation

### [[Fishie Land]] vs [[iBattus]]
[[Ssahan]] is caught stalking [[Fishie Land]] this would lead to a long chase where in the end [[Ssahan]] would combat log after a 3v1  

the crew would return back to base only to spot [[Ssahan]] on [[Fishie Land]] this would lead to the crew trapping [[Ssahan]] but he would escape yet again  

[[Fishie Land]] crew would set off on a quest to locate [[iBattus]] base and would end up finding their base. unfortunately [[iBattus]] would login while they are at his base leading to the war fuse lighting   
the whole battle was on sight, while the crew was jumping [[iBattus]]. [[Kuruzu_]] would also login for a while to help with the fight as [[iBattus]] kept on combat logging 


while [[iBattus]] was getting jumped [[Ssahan]] would go to [[Fishie Land]] and bomb the shit outa it blowing up all of the farms

[[WhoIsFishie]] would retaliate by blowing up and lava casting [[iBattus]] base

while this was going on [[iBattus]] was doing more damage to [[Fishie Land]] and would end up killing [[Mika]]

a final fight would take place at [[Fishie Land]] where [[iBattus]] and [[Ssahan]] would start to lose as their armor broke. this would lead to them running away with the [[Fishie Land]] crew chasing after them.

but for [[Anoojfunaid]] peace was never an option. with [[Mika]] killed a debt had to be paied back in blood.    
![[death of sshan.jpg]]    
with the slaying of [[Ssahan]] [[Fishie Land]] would claim victory. [[iBattus]] wont login to the server again after this bringing an end to [[Season 9]] 


[[iBattus]] would later claim he actually won cause he joined just to blow up [[Fishie Land]]

the plan really didnt work because [[Fishie Land]] would end up rebuilt again
