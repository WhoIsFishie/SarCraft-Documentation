#### Blood is in the air
tensions starts brewing between Nazi's and the [[Weebs]] and the final nail in the coffin was someone blowing up the bridge that connected Nazi base and [[Weebs]] base

this was a Redstone trap that got triggered by one of the [[Nazi]] player's almost killing him

[[Nazi]]'s blame the [[Weebs]] for the trap while the [[Weebs]] blamed the [[Nazi]]'s

[[Holy Knights of the Templars|CHSE]] later takes credit for the attack 

#### War time prep
with no more trust between factions Nazi's starts building up walls around their base to keep everyone out

> [!NOTE]
> Read more about [[Nazi Wall]]

another Sarcube is erected at the Nazi compound 

during this period the [[Nazi]]'s made advancements in redstone technology to keep up with the CHSE kids. this included contracting Cat to build a iron farm as well as multiple test runs with TNT nukes 

#### WAR
[[Holy Knights of the Templars|CHSE]] rebrands to Holy Knights of the Templars and declares war on [[Nazi]]

#### Hitler gets over thrown
with [[shihaam_me]] being inactive the leader of [[Nazi]] was in power of running the server and managing it. rest of the players on the server soon became fedup with [[Redacted]]'s rule and voted to over throw him
other players in [[Nazi]] also voted to overthrow [[Redacted]]

the leader in the revolution to overthrow [[Redacted]] was [[ToadGod]] as he was unhappy with the use of players hacking and diamonds not being used as a currency on the server 

thus killing Season 2
