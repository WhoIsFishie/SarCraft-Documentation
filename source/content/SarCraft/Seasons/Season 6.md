Code_Name : Racism Unlocked

In the tumultuous history of SarCraft, few chapters stand as dramatically transformative as Season 6 - a period that would forever change the landscape of player abilities, factional warfare, and server politics. Following the revolutionary chaos of [[Season 5]], players sought a new beginning, one that would introduce supernatural powers and ancient rivalries into the Minecraft world they had fought over for years.

## The Dawn of a New Era

In the aftermath of [[WhoIsFishie]]'s revolutionary victory in [[Season 5]], tensions remained high. The infamous admin abuse had left scars on the server's collective psyche, and trust was at an all-time low. Heated debates erupted over the future direction of SarCraft, with one central question dominating the discourse: would hacking be tolerated in this new world?

After days of diplomatic negotiations, players reached a consensus to officially ban hacking - a rule that would be tested to its limits in the coming months. Perhaps most surprising was the successful diplomatic mission to convince [[iBattus]] to return to the server after his humiliating defeat and obsidian imprisonment during the [[Season 5]] revolution.

"_If I'm coming back, we're doing something different,_" the former admin declared, setting the stage for the introduction of Origins mod - a game-changing addition that would grant players supernatural abilities based on their chosen race.

Unlike previous seasons, players had ambitious plans for Season 6. The world border was set at 10,000 blocks with intentions for a "forever world" - a realm that would expand with each passing season rather than resetting entirely. Little did they know that forces beyond their control would soon challenge this vision of permanence.

## Origins 

As players logged into the fresh world, they made choices that would define their gameplay experience and dictate new alliances:

- [[WhoIsFishie]] selected Spider, gaining wall-climbing abilities that would prove instrumental in his nefarious schemes
- [[iBattus]] chose Shulk, harnessing the power to store items within his body
- [[shinwo_o]] adopted Feline reflexes and night vision
- [[invisble715]], [[Buhkiru]] , [[Nausham]], and [[Anoojfunaid]] all selected Phantom, gaining the ability to phase through solid blocks
- [[shihaam_me]], in characteristic fashion, selected the mundane Human origin, solidifying his reputation for administrative mediocrity

These supernatural abilities fundamentally altered the power dynamics of SarCraft, turning ordinary players into demi-gods capable of feats previously achievable only through hacking or administrative commands.

## The End Portal Conspiracy

With their newfound powers, [[WhoIsFishie]] and the newly formalized [[Chicken Factory]] faction embarked on perhaps the most ambitious territorial control scheme in server history. Recognizing that the End dimension represented the ultimate endgame content, they devised a plan that would make them the gatekeepers to its riches.

A sophisticated nether highway system was constructed, allowing for rapid travel across the 10,000 block world at eight times the overworld speed. But this engineering marvel served a darker purpose - locating and systematically destroying every End portal in existence except one, which would remain under [[Chicken Factory]] control.

The method of destruction was ingenious in its simplicity: growing giant mushrooms directly into portal frames, replacing the irreplaceable End portal blocks with mundane fungal matter. [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Kuruzu_]] traversed thousands of blocks, methodically eliminating dimensional gateways one by one.

"_If we control the End, we control everything that comes from it,_" [[WhoIsFishie]] reportedly declared as another portal frame crumbled beneath a mushroom's expansion.

## The Egg race

As the End portal destruction campaign continued, a new player entered the scene - [[Nausham]], who cunningly infiltrated [[iBattus]]'s faction while secretly serving as a double agent for the [[Chicken Factory]].

Intelligence soon arrived that [[iBattus]] was planning an End raid to claim the Dragon Egg - the ultimate server trophy and a powerful symbol of dominance. The race was on.

[[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Buhkiru]] accelerated their portal destruction campaign, hoping to leave [[iBattus]] stranded without access to the End dimension. But despite their efforts, the impossible occurred - [[iBattus]] discovered an intact portal room.

In a desperate gambit, [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Buhkiru]] camped atop a portal room, careful not to trigger the stronghold achievement that might alert their rivals. The tension was palpable as they awaited word from their spy.

When the message finally came that [[iBattus]] had entered the End, the [[Chicken Factory]] forces sprang into action. Racing through dimensions, they arrived just as the Dragon was nearing death, launching a surprise attack on [[iBattus]].

The battle was chaotic, and in a cruel twist of fate, both [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Buhkiru]] fell into the return portal during the confrontation, teleporting back to [[Chicken Factory#Balls island]] while [[iBattus]] claimed the coveted Egg.

This defeat only strengthened [[Chicken Factory]]'s resolve. A new plan formed - [[Nausham]] would continue his deception, eventually convincing [[iBattus]] to allow him to hold the Egg. The moment the trophy changed hands, an Ender Pearl would be triggered, teleporting [[Nausham]] back to [[Chicken Factory#Balls island]] with the trophy.

## Login Bug

As factional tensions escalated, a server anomaly emerged that would reshape the conflict entirely. A critical flaw in the authentication plugin began causing players to randomly teleport to other players' locations upon login - effectively compromising base security across the entire server.

The bug reached its breaking point when [[WhoIsFishie]] was teleported directly to [[iBattus]]'s location, exposing the secret portal room that [[iBattus]] had been using.

What had begun as a technical glitch quickly evolved into a weaponized exploit as players realized its tactical potential. [[WhoIsFishie]] began duplicating Ender Chests, converting them to obsidian with the explicit purpose of filling strongholds with solid blocks, hoping to teleport [[iBattus]] into a suffocation trap.

The paranoia became so severe that [[iBattus]] refused to log in while other players were online, remaining in spectator mode to avoid potential ambushes.

## [[iBattus]] vs [[Buhkiru]]  

The hostilities erupted into direct confrontation when [[iBattus]] stumbled upon [[Buhkiru]]'s base during a farming session. What followed was a humiliating defeat for the former admin.

Facing certain death, [[iBattus]] committed the cardinal sin of combat logging - disconnecting during PvP to avoid death. This dishonorable tactic only emboldened [[Buhkiru]], who promptly constructed an obsidian cage around [[iBattus]]'s logout position, recreating the very imprisonment that had driven [[iBattus]] from [[Season 5]].

History, it seemed, was doomed to repeat itself.

## RIP Technoblade

On July 1st, somber news reached the server - Technoblade, the legendary Minecraft YouTuber and inspiration to many, had passed away. In a rare moment of unity, the [[Chicken Factory]] discussed transforming their base into a memorial statue in his honor, temporarily setting aside their factional schemes out of respect for the fallen content creator.

The consensus among players was clear - even in this chaotic realm of digital warfare, some things transcended the petty conflicts that defined SarCraft.


## Server Issues

Just as the server seemed to be reaching its dramatic climax, disaster struck from the outside world. [[shihaam_me]] lost SSH access to the server, rendering it inaccessible. Initially, players remained optimistic:

>No data is lost (yet at least)
>However I'm unable access server ssh and I'm not sure why
>I have to go somewhere in the morning, so I'm going to sleep now, will check on this tomorrow

### IRL ARC

As days turned into weeks, the situation grew dire. In a shocking revelation, it was discovered that the server host had been compromised by North Korean hackers who had repurposed the hardware for cryptocurrency mining operations.

With their digital playground inaccessible, players were forced into an unprecedented "IRL Arc" - meeting in person and engaging in real-world activities during the Eid celebration.

[[iBattus]], [[shihaam_me]], and [[flowerrthiccc]] documented their real-world meetup, posting videos and images that became infamous in the group chat. One video caption ominously declared "Sarcraft ain't coming back," sending waves of concern through the community.

Players responded with characteristic humor, cropping [[shihaam_me]]'s face from a group selfie and adding captions:

- "_POV: You won't get your items back_" —[[WhoIsFishie]]
- "_The last thing you see before the server runs into an issue_" —[[Kuruzu_]]
- "_Damn so no more sarcraft_" —[[Nausham]]

Even [[WhoIsFishie]] found a new purpose during the downtime, becoming a cat owner - perhaps finding a gentler outlet for his dominance than server politics.

After a full week of darkness, the server miraculously returned on July 9th, but the celebration would be short-lived.

## Season 6.5

In the cruelest twist of SarCraft fate, the server suffered catastrophic data loss, forcing yet another world reset. This new world, dubbed "Season 6.5," represented the breaking point for many players.

![[6.5.jpg]]   

In a spectacular display of digital nihilism, [[WhoIsFishie]], [[Buhkiru]], [[flowerrthiccc]], and [[Anoojfunaid]] flooded the spawn area with TNT, detonating it to crash the server and effectively ending Season 6 with the same anarchic spirit that had defined it.

The dream of a "forever world" had lasted barely more than two weeks, crushed under the weight of technical limitations and cosmic bad luck that seemed to follow SarCraft like a curse.

## Legacy of Origins

Despite its abbreviated run, Season 6 left an indelible mark on SarCraft history. It introduced supernatural abilities that would influence all future seasons, formalized the [[Chicken Factory]] as the server's most dominant faction, and demonstrated the incredible lengths players would go to secure territorial advantages.

The systematic destruction of End portals, the login bug warfare, and the epic Dragon Egg battle would be recounted in server lore for generations to come - tales of a golden age cut short by forces beyond even admin control.

As players dispersed after the TNT finale, they carried with them the memories of what might have been in this most ambitious and ultimately doomed chapter of SarCraft history.
