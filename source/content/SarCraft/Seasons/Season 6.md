long arguments were had to convince [[iBattus]] to come back to the server
players decide to use the origins mod to spice things up

![[ibut base teardown.jpg]]
preparing for the new Season [[iBattus]] would tear down his entire base to bring it with him to the new season

this season had plans of keeping a forever world. so the world border was locked at 10k with plans to expand the border every season 
## Origins

[[iBattus]] picks Shulk   
[[Buhkiru]] picks Blaze  
[[shinwo_o]] picks Feline  
[[invisble715]] picks Phantom  
[[Nausham]] picks Phantom  
[[Anoojfunaid]] picks Phantom  
[[shihaam_me]] picks Human   

## The Egg race
[[Nausham]] joins the server and pretends to join [[iBattus]]. acting as a double agent [[Nausham]] would tell [[Chicken Factory]] about [[iBattus]]'s plans to raid the end to get the egg before [[WhoIsFishie]] does

hearing that it was about to go down [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Buhkiru]] starts a project to delete all the end portals except on in a 10k area from spawn hoping that this would slow down [[iBattus]]. 100's of portals are deleted during this period using the mushroom exploit  

on the day of the end raid [[Nausham]] [[Buhkiru]] and [[WhoIsFishie]] gets on a call. [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Buhkiru]] camps on top of a portal room as to not trigger the achievement while [[iBattus]] and [[Nausham]] tries to locate a portal. to everyone's surprise [[iBattus]] finds a portal room and goes in. as the dragon is about to die [[Buhkiru]] and [[WhoIsFishie]] jumps into the end and attacks [[iBattus]]

### the end fight
things did not go as planned as while trying to capture the egg [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Buhkiru]] both falls inside the portal and gets teleported back to [[Chicken Factory#Balls island]]
![[bassam_listen2whitegirl_music.mp4]]
this failed operation would lead to [[Nausham]] staying as a double agent for even longer with plans of stealing the egg from [[iBattus]]

the plan was to have [[Nausham]] as [[iBattus]] to hold the egg and as soon as he picks it up [[Chicken Factory]] would trigger an ender pearl to teleport [[Nausham]] to [[Chicken Factory#Balls island]] securing the egg 
## Login Bug

the bug would reach a boiling point when it teleports [[WhoIsFishie]] to [[iBattus]] location and expose the portal room used by [[iBattus]]
[[iBattus]] would send the following image to [[flowerrthiccc]]

> [[Exploits#Identity Theft]]

this bug would get weaponized by all users and would lead to a stand off between [[iBattus]] and [[WhoIsFishie]] where both players tried to kill each other. [[WhoIsFishie]] would dupe a bunch of ender chests and convert it to obsidian to fill an entire stronghold with obsidian so that he can teleport [[iBattus]] and suffocate him. [[iBattus]] would be in spectator mode this entire time refusing to login in

due to the exploit [[iBattus]] stops being active while other players are online on the server
