Code_Name :  forgotten history

In the tumultuous history of SarCraft, some periods stand as pillars of chaos and glory, while others fade into obscurity, lost to time and server crashes. Season 4 is one such forgotten chapter - a fleeting moment in the server's grand narrative that lasted mere days before vanishing into the digital void.

## The Forgotten Season

Following the dramatic 13-day chaos of [[Season 3]], SarCraft went dark. For nearly a year, the server lay dormant, a digital wasteland awaiting rebirth. Then, on April 12, 2021, [[shihaam_me]] resurrected the server in what he hoped would herald a new age of prosperity and adventure.

Little did the players know they were stepping into what would become the most ephemeral season in SarCraft history.

### New Blood

Two players who would later become legendary figures in SarCraft lore made their first appearances during this forgotten season:

[[WhoIsFishie]] - A name that would later strike fear into the hearts of players as the revolutionary leader who brought [[Season 5]] to its knees.

[[iBattus]] - The future admin whose rivalry with [[WhoIsFishie]] would shape the destiny of entire seasons.

Their arrival during this brief window would prove fateful, planting the seeds for conflicts that would blossom into full-scale revolution in the seasons to come.

### Technical Catastrophe

The doomed nature of Season 4 wasn't entirely the fault of SarCraft's infamous instability. Minecraft itself was undergoing significant transitions, with the Caves and Cliffs update causing widespread compatibility issues across all servers.

These technical challenges, combined with SarCraft's own notorious infrastructure problems, created the perfect storm. Within days of its creation, the server began to falter, plagued by crashes, lag, and corrupted chunks.

### The Final Monument

In what would become his signature move across every season, [[shihaam_me]] managed to construct his iconic [[SarCube]] - a cobblestone monstrosity that served as both a shelter and a monument to administrative mediocrity.

This humble structure would stand as perhaps the only lasting achievement of Season 4, a silent sentinel watching over a realm destined for oblivion.

The server died not with the dramatic flair of admin abuse or factional warfare that characterized other seasons, but with a quiet whimper - its players logging out one day, never to return to this particular iteration of SarCraft.

Season 4 faded into obscurity, becoming little more than a footnote in server history. Yet it served a crucial purpose in the grand tapestry of SarCraft's evolution - introducing key players whose conflicts would define the server's future and setting the stage for what would become the most infamous chapter yet: [[Season 5|The Age of Revolution]].
