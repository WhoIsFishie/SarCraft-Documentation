## editors note
we must hold on to the memories of the good old days as age betrays our mind 

I make this for all of the lovely players who I built together and fought against

We all had our experience on this server during our golden years and I wouldn't trade anything for those memories 

This site shall be up for anyone who'd like to look back and for anyone who'd like to read up on the history of the best server in Maldives
