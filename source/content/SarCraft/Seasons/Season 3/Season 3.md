### Season History

#### Sar moment
[[shihaam_me]] accidently deletes server 1 day into the new season 

#### Just Iron
while [[Redacted]] is trying to leave spawn he encounters [[shihaam_me]]. with tensions still high [[Redacted]] kills [[shihaam_me]] and steals his iron before leaving spawn

#### Spawn Disagreement
a huge fight breaks out among the [[Spawn Mason]]'s leading to some of the players leaving spawn

[[Nausham]] and [[GurdhaanRamzee]] decides to join up with [[Redacted]] thus reviving the [[Nazi]] faction yet again

##### Operation Search And Rescue
[[Redacted]] was stuck inside a cave running low on food with no pickaxe. [[Nausham]] and [[GurdhaanRamzee]] goes in for a extraction mission

this was unsuccessful as they all died and also lost all of the mined items

#### The Egg Heist
##### The Great Migration
[[Nazi]]'s uses the server seed to find the closest End portal room and goes on a great migration 
this was to abuse a new rule [[ToadGod]] has implemented which prevents players from entering other players bases without permission thus locking other players out of the closest end portal to spawn

##### The Great Sike of Toad
[[ToadGod]] is seen in chat talking about his plans to raid the end and bring everyone elytra's

![[toad_finds_nazi_hideout.jpg]]

while nether traveling [[ToadGod]]'s portal accidently connects with the [[Nazi]] base portal

[[Nazi]]'s decides to raid the end before this and steal the egg as time was running out


#### DUPES DUPES DUPES

while messing around the [[Nazi]]'s discovers a powerful dupe that allows them to duplicate 100's of items at once 

this starts a race to find enchanted golden apples so it can be duped
![[expensive donkey.jpg]]
[[GurdhaanRamzee]] finds an enchanted golden apple but accidently feeds it to the donkey that's used to dupe items 

[[Nazi]] nukes their base and decides to migrate again to a place where they can safely dupe and store their stashes 

![[migration2.jpg]]

they travel via nether with their horses and the dupe donkeys 

##### tower to heaven
![[tower to heavin.jpg]]
the tower to heaven is a wooden structure built to build limit
at the top of the tower is a nether portal
the reason for building this tower was to transport the horses through the portal and they didn't want to have a portal linking issue again

>the [[Nazi]]'s are not really known for their logical thinking. just their random, expensive and over engineered buildings and this would be one of those 
>
>the same thing can be achieved by building the portal on the roof and sending the horses through it and breaking the portal

![[tower to heavin burning.jpg]]

the tower is burned once the horses are sent as to erase any evidence of a portal being built there

##### Sky Island 
![[sky island.jpg]]
Sky Island is a duping station built up in the sky in the middle of an ocean
this was done so that other players wont accidently run into it
this small obsidian platform was used to do all the duping for [[Nazi]]
the rest of the server was not aware of this exploit


#### Nazi vs Spawn masons
[[Nazi]]'s needed a Beacon to dupe but didn't have one. [[ToadGod]] was in possession of one but refuses to give it to the Nazi's 

this leads to the [[Nazi]]'s going to spawn in the middle of the night while everyone was asleep and erecting a diamond penis Infront of [[ToadGod]]'s base 
![[penis.jpg]]
>once again the [[Nazi]]'s are not known for their practicality when it comes to builds.

the next morning a fight breaks out in the server group chat due to the structure

##### Pissing contest
![[penis map.jpg]]![[view from toad spawn base.jpg]]

[[ToadGod]] claims that the build counts as griefing 
[[Nazi]]'s claim its a building they made at spawn as a pitstop since they fly to spawn a lot 
[[ToadGod]] claims that [[Nazi]]'s has no claim to the land the penis was built on
[[Nazi]]'s claims that everyone has claim to spawn and its their spot on spawn as they cleared out an unclaimed forest area to build it 
[[Nazi]]'s claim the beacon they installed in the penis will be of great contribution to the [[Spawn Mason]]

[[CatMDV]] is quoted saying 
> If it was a dick made out of obs, im not interested

[[Redacted]] claims ownership of the island the penis is on 
[[ToadGod]] is against it as he doesn't wanna look at a diamond penis 
[[ToadGod]] tries to take down the penis
[[Nazi]] claim that would count as griefing as they own the island and the penis

the issue is taken to court with [[shihaam_me]] being the judge
[[CatMDV]] leaves as he doesn't wanna entertain kids arguing over a penis in Minecraft
[[ToadGod]] keeps pissing off the judge by speaking without permission 


the judge comes to a verdict 

>This action do not count as grieing
>However
>Believe a dick is structure do not count SFW
>[[Nazi]] Take it down and you may continue to build in that island as long as it do not disturb [[Spawn Mason]]
>[[Spawn Mason]] state your terms allowing them to build in that island that won't disturb you

the players are now allowed to speak

[[ToadGod]] responds to the judge
>I can't grant permission for them to build there. It's next to my base literally. That is also where a path is going to be to connect my base to the village.. 
>We agreed to not meddle, build or build near each other's bases at the start of the season. Not even a month and they already started being toxic again. Heevanee bureega kashi jahaigen ulheyhen. "Oh shit I can't stop being toxic and a nuisance to others omg ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨"
>My request is that they build in their village and near their village. This is ridiculous.

[[Redacted]] responds
>i don't think we need his perms to build on the land just because its within the render distance of his base
>we scouted the area to build and most places were full of creeper holes and it was unsafe to build so we settled on the island 
>we cleared out the land and flattened it i believe we should be able to keep the land we worked on 
>as far as the toxic claims i think we have been civil through out the hearing and not called anyone names
>i was not aware of the no nsfw rule since i agreed to the ones on tele
>but now that i have been notified that discord rules are the ones enforced
>we agree to take down the penis and follow the discord rules

[[GurdhaanRamzee]] responds
>First of all, the land had no claim on it, there were only naturally generated stuff in the area, trees and dirt hills. We took them down ourselves, we cleared the area out ourselves. We made sure they didnâ€™t have any claim on the land before we built it. Iâ€™m in the middle of taking down the penis since it goes against the rules. Iâ€™ve already built a wall made of diamonds showing that this is the piece of land that we want and I think itâ€™s a reasonable chunk of land. Had they atleast lit up the place we wouldâ€™ve left it alone. But they didnâ€™t. If they lay claim to the land and wanted to build in it later, they shouldâ€™ve laid claim to it by atleast lighting it up, which they havenâ€™t. So I think we have full freedom to build whatever we want over there as long as it follows the rules of the game. 
>I believe weâ€™ve been civil in this conversation. We havenâ€™t gone around calling each other names and I would very much appreciate it if no one else does it to us also.

the judge concludes the hearing with the verdict


#### Price of iron
[[shihaam_me]] announces that [[Redacted]] is banned from the server
server goes into chaos as the 2 factions start blaming each other
the reason for the ban was that [[shihaam_me]] was fed-up with the arguments and people complaining to him and he blames the [[Season 3#Just Iron]] incident for it 

server is shut down
