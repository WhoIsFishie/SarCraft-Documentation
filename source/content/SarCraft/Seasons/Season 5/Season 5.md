## Business relations gone wrong
[[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]] continues to work together on raids and build as they both trade with each other
[[WhoIsFishie]] suggests the following to [[iBattus]]
>You guys should use the bone from the skeleton farm to get a bunch of stick from a bamboo farm

and offers to help them build it as [[WhoIsFishie]] was actively using their farms 
while building together [[iBattus]] gets suspicious of [[WhoIsFishie]]'s pickaxe as it seems faster then other pickaxes
[[WhoIsFishie]] claims its just good because he has a gaming chair
[[iBattus]] keeps on requesting to take a look at [[WhoIsFishie]]'s pickaxe but [[WhoIsFishie]] claims [[iBattus]] is hallucinating 

[[iBattus]] is sure that [[WhoIsFishie]] is hacking but he cant prove it

while building [[WhoIsFishie]] gets kicked from the server due to lag and [[iBattus]] places a block where [[WhoIsFishie]] logged out. this causes [[WhoIsFishie]] to start suffocating when he logs back in
![[ibut_killfish.mp4]]
[[iBattus]] decides to let [[WhoIsFishie]] die so that he can take a look at [[WhoIsFishie]]'s inventory to check the pickaxe

[[iBattus]] now has evidence that [[WhoIsFishie]] was hacking 

![[bamboo_farm.jpg]]
the farm [[iBattus]] and [[WhoIsFishie]] built together

the farm would later get blown up by creepers prompting [[iBattus]] to add the following measures to prevent creepers
![[creeper protection.jpg]]![[creeper protection_2.jpg]]


## Calm before the storm
it would be around this time that [[flowerrthiccc]] would join the server
[[iBattus]] would help [[flowerrthiccc]] setup 

players would later express their concern as [[WhoIsFishie]] isnt seen on the server as it was rare to see [[WhoIsFishie]] offline

![[Pasted image 20250216131101.png]]

[[iBattus]], [[invisble715]] would go on an adventure to explore the nether 
[[invisble715]] would die a few times during this trip

#### [[iBattus]] Dies
while in the nether [[iBattus]] finds himself in a sticky situation where he is low on health and needs backup

he would die 4 times while trying to get his items back
while trying to save [[iBattus]] [[flowerrthiccc]] would also die continuing on a history of sarcraft [[Season 3#Operation Search And Rescue|failed rescue missions]] 


### Stuck in holes
[[WhoIsFishie]] invites [[TheHarryG]]

[[WhoIsFishie]] invites [[Buhkiru]]

[[WhoIsFishie]] invites [[StrawBwabii]]

[[WhoIsFishie]] and [[TheHarryG]] decides to dig a hole all the way down to bedrock and [[TheHarryG]] was supposed to activate [[WhoIsFishie]]'s pearl so he will teleport back
however [[TheHarryG]] also falls in the same hole so now both of them are stuck in a 1 block hole in the bedrock

[[CatMDV|Cat]] comes to save [[WhoIsFishie]]

`End: May 4, 2022 5:06 AM`
`https://t.me/sarcraftmcgc/13585`

`Total downtime:  5 hours 51 minutes`

`Reason: SarDC AC is retarded (Home AC turned on automatically, overloaded itself, killed the circuit breaker and everything at home with it)`

## Fishie Sells houses
[[ButtercupHoney]] and [[Azuwlaa]] joines the server and [[WhoIsFishie]] takes this oppotunity to sell a house for them

he does this by blocking them inside a random hole and telling them its their new house until they agrees

## Stuck in the nether
[[Buhkiru]] ends up getting stuck in the nether bedrock
![[stuck_1.jpg]]
[[ButtercupHoney]] goes to save [[Buhkiru]] since [[WhoIsFishie]] was busy
![[save_2.jpg]]
[[ButtercupHoney]] also gets stuck
[[TheHarryG]] also gets stuck

its unclear to this day as to how they got unstuck

## Shutdown of May 10
due to [[shihaam_me]] not having money to pay his bills server is shut down until he gets enough donations
a few mins later the donation goal of MVR 371 is reached and the server is back online

## [[CatMDV|Cat]] Wants to Rebuild Male'
[[CatMDV|Cat]] has an idea to build a 1:1 scale replica of Male' in minecraft as it would be news worthy 
![[male_map.jpg]]

players entertain the idea for a day and then forgets about it as they realize it would be too much work

## The Reset of May 13

on the 13th of May 4:34 PM [[TheHarryG]] logs into the world to see it has been reverted to an old update

the last time players were online on the server was early morning of May 13th at 2 AM

upon further investigation it was noted that the server backup has not been active for 10 days and its running the newest backup it has which was taken on May 3 2022, 11:14PM

#### Deleted builds
![[berry bridge.jpg]]

![[flower trading hall.jpg]]
[[flowerrthiccc]]'s trading hall


players started demanding compensation for the loss 
[[TheHarryG]] requests creative mode


#### Incident report
>So what happened was
>After the last power cut, when sar was on island, the backup script was not working because of one file. (The file is just a text file).....
>So basically no backups after that day was written But everything was running on ram disk fine until today there was another powercut....
>So we lose all....
[[iBattus]]


>I would like to apologize once again and I will do everything to make sure this never happens again.

## Fishurance 
not to let a tragedy go to waste [[WhoIsFishie]] announces an insurance plan where all players give him 1 diamond everyday to join the insurance plan

no one purchased the insurance plan

## Revolution
[[TheHarryG]] and [[WhoIsFishie]] starts talking about compensation again and [[shihaam_me]] creates a poll to see if players should be compensated or not

6 voted no and only 5 voted yes

the server splits into 2 as [[iBattus]] claims its not fair to compensate 
[[WhoIsFishie]] decided to use the vote results as a kill list for the server

[[WhoIsFishie]] builds a bunch of penis's on [[shihaam_me]]'s base in protest

in the background [[WhoIsFishie]] was planning to overthrow the government 

![[bamboo threats.jpg]]
the revolution party would plant a bunch of bamboo at [[shihaam_me]] base to hold it hostage 

the point of the bamboo was to lag out the server when [[shihaam_me]] gets online to break it down

there was also lava traps placed at world height which would rain down lava on [[shihaam_me]]'s base if he removes the bamboo 

hearing the news [[TheHarryG]] and [[flowerrthiccc]] joins [[WhoIsFishie]] to get compensation 

while [[shihaam_me]] was getting online [[flowerrthiccc]] joins the cause to plant even more bamboo 

operation bamboo goes on for 2 days 

![[Pasted image 20250216154733.png]]

[[shihaam_me]] dies to the lava from the sky

after [[shihaam_me]] was taken care of the next target was [[iBattus]] as he is also an admin

> ibattus: if i die from u guys, ill admin abuse

[[WhoIsFishie]] and [[flowerrthiccc]] jumps [[iBattus]] and forces him to combat log
[[WhoIsFishie]] would cover the spot [[iBattus]] logged out at with obsidian so that now he can hold another admin hostage until items that were lost gets returned

[[iBattus]] refuses to meet with the demands even at half a heart
[[shihaam_me]] refuses to save [[iBattus]]

[[iBattus]] would get online on his alt account to go and save himself from the cage

[[shihaam_me]] comes back to kill [[WhoIsFishie]] but dies to thorns damage

a new vote takes place
80% voted to comply with [[WhoIsFishie]]'s demands
[[shihaam_me]] voted to kick out [[WhoIsFishie]]

after hours of negotiation [[shihaam_me]] finally decides to comply
[[shihaam_me]] requests that players give him the command for the items as he is too lazy to write the commands himself

[[shihaam_me]] starts spamming [[WhoIsFishie]] with dirt

[[TheHarryG]] tricks shihaam into running a command
>/cli give TheHarryG chest{BlockEntityTag:{Items:[{Slot:0,id:totem_of_undying,Count:1},{Slot:1,id:emerald_block,Count:64},{Slot:2,id:trident,Count:1,tag:{Enchantments:[{id:unbreaking,lvl:3},{id:impaling,lvl:5},{id:riptide,lvl:3},{id:mending,lvl:1}]}},{Slot:3,id:netherite_block,Count:3},{Slot:4,id:ender_chest,Count:64},{Slot:5,id:diamond_block,Count:9},{Slot:6,id:iron_block,Count:64},{Slot:7,id:iron_block,Count:64},{Slot:8,id:golden_apple,Count:64},{Slot:9,id:gold_block,Count:64},{Slot:10,id:observer,Count:64},{Slot:11,id:piston,Count:64},{Slot:12,id:sticky_piston,Count:64},{Slot:13,id:black_shulker_box,Count:1},{Slot:14,id:totem_of_undying,Count:1}]}} 1

[[iBattus]] unhappy with [[shihaam_me]] running a command without checking resigns from admin

[[shihaam_me]] runs another command
>/cli give WhoIsFishie chest{BlockEntityTag:{Items:[{Slot:0,id:emerald_block,Count:2},{Slot:1,id:gunpowder,Count:64},{Slot:2,id:golden_carrot,Count:64},{Slot:3,id:slime_ball,Count:32},{Slot:4,id:ghast_tear,Count:32},{Slot:5,id:diamond_chestplate,Count:2,tag:{Enchantments:[{id:protection,lvl:10},{id:thorns,lvl:5},{id:unbreaking,lvl:20},{id:mending,lvl:1}]}}]}} 2



## Admin Power Trip

![[power_trip.png]]

with the newly learned commands [[shihaam_me]] goes on a power trip
[[WhoIsFishie]] and [[TheHarryG]] gets banned for sneaking into the end. while in the end [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[TheHarryG]] collects shulker boxes 
the ban is revoked after a few mins

[[shihaam_me]] starts flying around in creative and randomly giving other players creative
[[shihaam_me]] starts smiting players 
[[shihaam_me]] spawns a dragon into the world because he was bored

## Aftermath
[[shihaam_me]] puts himself into survival after 1hr of power trip and decides to go live in a village far far away
except he runs into [[WhoIsFishie]]'s hidden base
[[WhoIsFishie]] unable to kill [[shihaam_me]] as it would leak his coords instructs [[shihaam_me]] to simply leave 

once things finally calms down [[iBattus]] escapes his cage with the help of [[invisble715]]
![[ibut escapes.jpg]]


players are shocked to find that there is an extra enter dragon at spawn 
![[dragon.jpg]]
the players unite to kill the dragon 

## Chicken Factory
[[WhoIsFishie]] fills [[flowerrthiccc]]'s house with chickens

![[chicken breeder.jpg]]
![[chimken.jpg]]
[[WhoIsFishie]] installs a auto chick farm that would randomly drop eggs all over [[iBattus]] base

## [[WhoIsFishie]] vs [[iBattus]]
[[iBattus]] demands a 1v1 with [[WhoIsFishie]] so both players meetup at spawn to fight

both players had hacked clients on at a this fight 

at the start of the fight [[iBattus]] would get jumpped by phantoms and [[WhoIsFishie]] would use this to his advantage and pop one of [[iBattus]] totams 

[[Kuruzu_]] would logon during the fight to spectate and [[iBattus]] would assume its suddenly a 2v1 and prematurely attack [[Kuruzu_]] this would result in [[Kuruzu_]] retaliating  with rocket launchers and [[iBattus]] would run away

not really knowing how to use hacks [[iBattus]] would have auto tool enabled which would work against his favor on multiple occasions

[[iBattus]] would pop multiple totams during this fight

[[iBattus]] would later accuse [[WhoIsFishie]] of not taking any damage. but in reality [[WhoIsFishie]] was popping gapps so the resistance was making up for the health loss

[[iBattus]] would run away after [[WhoIsFishie]] offered him apples

there would be multiple other fights between [[iBattus]] and [[WhoIsFishie]] and it would always end with [[iBattus]] either running away or combat logging

## Wither on the lose
[[WhoIsFishie]], [[Kuruzu_]] and [[flowerrthiccc]] would go to the mushroom island to spawn a bunch of withers which would get a bit out of control



## Crystal pranks
[[WhoIsFishie]] plants a Crystal infront of [[TheHamkerCat]] and tells him its his pet now
[[TheHamkerCat]] falls for this atleast 4 times 
[[WhoIsFishie]] then tries to sell a house to [[TheHamkerCat]]

## Ethics of farming
[[WhoIsFishie]] fills [[flowerrthiccc]] house with chickens again and she kills them again claiming its unethical to breed that many chickens

[[WhoIsFishie]] starts spamming chickens so that for every chicken that dies 2 more will take its place

## [[iBattus]] Lurking
even after leaving the server [[iBattus]] can be seen lurking in the groupchat and arguing with players 

after watching [[WhoIsFishie]]'s video [[iBattus]] accuses [[WhoIsFishie]] of hacking
little did he know [[WhoIsFishie]] wasnt just hacking but also using a duplication exploit as well
## Egg
[[Nathuf_Nazim]] raids the end and collects the egg before [[WhoIsFishie]] is able to

## End of the Season
Season 5 didnt go out in a bang like previous season did
over time players lost interest and one day the server just shut down
it was a slow death with random server downtime that players didnt notice since no one was playing
