The Great Nazi wall is a project built by the [[Nazi]]'s to keep out other factions from there base after a bombing incident on their bridge.

the lead architect for the wall is [[GurdhaanRamzee]] a Nazi member

historian accounts shows that this wall was impractical, expensive and outright done poorly

for starters an entire Dark ork forest was chopped down to get the Logs needed for the build as the building plans asked for logs instead of plans to preserve the aesthetics of the wall

even by the end of the server the wall was never completed
