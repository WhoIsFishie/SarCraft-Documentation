![[hacked leggings.png]]

this is an item owned by [[Chicken Factory]] its unknown if it was ever used in any fight as no one wanted the existence of it to get leaked to the rest of the server

## Exploits

### Chunk Dupe of [[Season 2]]
a method of overloading a chunk to save its state would allow players to duplicate all items in a chunk. its unknown if [[Nazi]]'s used this or not.

### Donkey Dupe of [[Season 3]]
a 2 man exploit where one person rides a donkey and logs off while another player keeps the donkey's inventory open. this would allow [[Nazi]]'s to duplicate multiple items and is the main reason for their fixation on horse breeding 

### Shulker Dupe of [[Season 5]]  
A duplication exploit used by player [[WhoIsFishie]], who created a custom mod disguised as a shulker box sorting utility. The mod was cleverly designed to avoid detection by appearing as a legitimate quality-of-life modification. When opening a shulker box, the mod would present two seemingly innocent sorting buttons that actually enabled:

- Duplication of the first item in the box
- Duplication of the entire shulker box contents

The mod was distributed privately among a select group of players and remained undetected by administration due to its deceptive nature.

### Coords Leak
the auth plugin used by SarCraft does not hide users coordinates when they are unauthed leading to anyone being able to login as any user and getting their last logged out location 

### Invincibility 
a bug in earlier auth plugin would allow users to be between states of authed and unauthed 
this would results in users being able to deal damage but not take any. while players would be unable to move while in this state they can deal infinite amount of damage to enemies and players. this exploit was used by [[Nazi]] faction members to cheese the Ender Dragon fight


### Identity Theft
yet another bug in the Auth plugin which would confuse the plugin as to who is who. leading players to swap sessions or switch player locations in game. this exploit was so overpowered that it lead to players bases getting leaked 


### Session Exploit
this is a bug in one of the Auth plugins used where if a player connects right after disconnecting it wont request for password. the flaw in the plugin was that it didnt confirm if the new connection is the same ip as the one used to create the session  
[[iBattus]] claims [[WhoIsFishie]] used this exploit   
[[WhoIsFishie]] denies such accusations
