with the limitation of villager trading and new items being added via mods that might not be obtainable due to the small world size a shop was built at spawn for [[shihaam_me]]

the pourpus of this shop is for players to be able to trade for items with the admins that is no longer obtainable.

[[Buhkiru]] would buy the globe banner pattern from the shop due to villeger trading being disabled

[[StrawBwabii]] would buy the new seeds for plants added by the week 4 modpack update

the shop would not be often utilized as it was generally agreed upon players that its a last resort option rather then a shortcut for items.

the shop would accept emeralds as payments
