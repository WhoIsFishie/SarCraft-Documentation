# The Bleeding World
## The Crimson Mystery

In the darkest depths of [[Season 10]], a terrifying discovery shook the SarCraft community to its core. Miners began reporting strange occurrences deep beneath the surface - random patches of blood-red wool embedded within solid stone, appearing where diamond ore should have been. As if the world itself was hemorrhaging, these crimson anomalies spread throughout the underground, witnessed by player after player who ventured into the mines.

What began as isolated incidents quickly transformed into widespread panic as players documented dozens of these bleeding wounds scattered throughout the world. No region was spared from this crimson corruption.

## The Blood of the Earth

The [[Chicken Factory]] - always keen to uncover server conspiracies - developed a chilling theory that would spread like wildfire through the SarCraft community. According to their investigations, these weren't simple glitches or random occurrences. The red wool represented something far more sinister: _the world was literally bleeding_.

Whispers spread through server chat of invisible admin activities, suggesting the SarCraft admins were conducting forbidden experiments behind the scenes.

Some players reported hearing faint heartbeat sounds near red wool clusters, though these claims were never verified. Others claimed the patches grew in size over time, consuming more of the stone around them like an infection spreading through tissue.

## boring real explanation
when coding the plugin to delete diamond ores [[WhoIsFishie]] accidently made it replace them with red wool and forgot to update the code to actually replace them with stone
