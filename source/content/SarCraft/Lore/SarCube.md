Sarcube is a structure built by [[shihaam_me]] almost every season
![[sar spawn cube.jpg]]
its often built out of cobblestone, sometimes you may find a poorly built cobble stone generator nearby 

![[sarcube.jpg]]

the size of the cube can vary but if you see a stupid cube of cobble you can be sure that [[shihaam_me]] is somewhere nearby.
![[sarcube_exe.jpg]]
the loot in these structures are often bad so no point in looting. if you do find iron in a SarCube do not touch it


in season 10 [[Buhkiru]] would document the building on Sarcraft over the span of 2 days
