Sarcube is a structure built by [[shihaam_me]] almost every season
![[sar spawn cube.jpg]]
its often built out of cobblestone, sometimes you may find a poorly built cobble stone generator nearby

the size of the cube can vary but if you see a stupid cube of cobble you can be sure that [[shihaam_me]] is somewhere nearby.

the loot in these structures are often bad so no point in looting. if you do find iron in a SarCube do not touch it
