# The Great Guardian Infiltration: Ocean Monument Conspiracy

During Season 10 of SarCraft, players began noticing a bizarre phenomenon - ocean monuments were appearing at an alarming rate, sometimes with inexplicable generation glitches. What started as a curious anomaly quickly evolved into one of SarCraft's most elaborate conspiracy theories.

## The World's Immune Response

The [[Chicken Factory]], after extensive investigation of both the [[Red Wool]] phenomenon and the ocean monument proliferation, published a shocking theory that would forever change how players viewed their world:

> "The ocean monuments aren't random glitches - they're the world trying to heal itself. Each monument is essentially a giant stone pimple forming around infection sites caused by admin tampering." â€”[[WhoIsFishie]]

According to this theory, the mysterious red wool patches (the "bleeding" of the world) were symptoms of an underlying corruption in the server's code. The world, like any living organism fighting an infection, was responding by forming hardened structures around these wounds - ocean monuments.

## Evidence Supporting the Theory

- Ocean monuments were appearing most frequently in areas where red wool patches had been documented
- The prismarine material of monuments closely resembled scar tissue when viewed at certain angles
- Guardians appeared to be "white blood cells" - actively attacking any player who approached these healing sites
- Mining fatigue wasn't a mob effect but the world's attempt to prevent players from reopening its wounds

## The Guardian Pustules

Players began referring to the monuments as "guardian pustules" - necessary but unsightly formations the world was creating to encapsulate the red wool infection and prevent it from spreading further. The Elder Guardians represented concentrated healing energy - which explained their ability to inflict mining fatigue (the world's way of saying "please don't pick at this scab").

## The Healing Cycle Theory

The Chicken Factory documented what they called the "Healing Cycle" - a process where:

1. Admin tampering would cause a "wound" in the world (red wool)
2. The server would attempt to heal by forming a monument around the affected area
3. Guardians would spawn to protect the healing site

## The Sponge Connection

In perhaps the most compelling piece of evidence, players noticed that monuments contained sponges - the only block in Minecraft specifically designed to absorb liquid. This wasn't coincidence, they argued, but the world's attempt to "soak up" the bleeding caused by the red wool.

## Administrative Cover-Up

When players attempted to document this phenomenon by breaking into monuments near red wool sites, they often found the wool had been mysteriously replaced with stone - evidence, they claimed, of admins attempting to cover up their mistakes.

One player reported overhearing admin [[shihaam_me]] saying: "Don't tell them about the wool-monument connection. Just say it's normal generation." This alleged statement only fueled the conspiracy further.

## The SarCube Theory

Some players even connected the mysterious [[SarCube]] structures built by [[shihaam_me]] to the monuments, suggesting they were primitive attempts to create artificial "healing nodes" to counteract the bleeding. The cobblestone composition of [[SarCube]]s was supposedly chosen for its natural affinity with stone, making it compatible with the world's healing processes.


## boring real explanation
one of the admins added a anti seedcracker plugin which would mess with the generation of structures. in cases of land structures if they are offset and end up in the water instead of the structure an ocean monument gets spawned 

this information was discovered by #AXIS after they stole the server seed
