## The Explorer and Legal Counsel

In the dynamic landscape of SarCraft's history, few newcomers have made such an immediate impact as Donut. Joining during the ambitious Season 10, this player rapidly established herself as both an intrepid explorer and a shrewd legal mind, becoming an integral part of the notorious Chicken Factory faction.

### Season History

#### Season 10 - The Pioneer

Donut's introduction to SarCraft was nothing short of legendary. Within mere days of joining the server, she partnered with veteran player [[WhoIsFishie]] to accomplish what many had deemed impossible - visiting all four world borders in just three days.

The Four Corners Expedition became one of Season 10's most impressive early achievements. Supported by [[Chicken Factory]] members [[Klen04]] and [[Buhkiru]], Donut and [[WhoIsFishie]] prepared diamond gear and embarked on their journey with a strategic plan.

What made this expedition particularly noteworthy wasn't just the incredible distance covered (over 80,000 blocks of terrain), but Donut's unique approach to exploration. Throughout the journey, she meticulously collected flowers from each biome they encountered.

Even more characteristic was her habit of adopting animals along the way. Despite the serious nature of their mission, Donut couldn't resist befriending wolves, cats, and other creatures they encountered. By journey's end, she had accumulated a small menagerie that followed the expedition, much to [[WhoIsFishie]]'s amused frustration when these pets would wander off with valuable supplies stored in their inventory chests.

#### Season 10 - The Counselor

Following the notorious Telegram exploit incident, Donut revealed her talents as a legal mind by serving as defense counsel for [[WhoIsFishie]] in what became known as "The Trial of the Century."

During this landmark trial, Donut showed remarkable legal acumen despite being new to the server. Her defense of [[WhoIsFishie]] against accusations of possessing illegal items proved successful, resulting in all major charges being dropped.

Her loyalty to animals extended even to her legal work, as demonstrated when she refused to represent [[Anoojfunaid]] after he killed Adhuray the endermite. When approached by the desperate player seeking counsel, Donut declined, declaring her moral allegiance to the fallen pet. This ethical stance showed how her love for animals influenced even her most professional endeavors.

#### Season 10 - The Explorer of the Nether

When the Nether was unlocked in Week 2 of Season 10, Donut immediately joined [[WhoIsFishie]] in exploring this dangerous dimension. Together they collected blaze rods and, by remarkable coincidence, acquired wither skeleton skulls at the exact same time as [[TheHarryG|12OK]] and [[Buhkiru]].

Their exploration of a bastion remnant yielded valuable ancient debris, once again demonstrating Donut's knack for resource gathering and exploration.

#### Season 10 - The Prankster

Beyond exploration and legal work, Donut showed her playful side through various pranks across the server. After the unwhitelisting of [[iBattus]] and [[Ssahan]], Donut and [[StrawBwabii]] egged [[athphane]]'s house and left signs blaming the removed players.

Many of her pranks involved animals in creative ways. During the death competition with [[StrawBwabii]], she engaged in what server logs described as an unusual activity that generated hundreds of "fell from a high place" messages over nearly an hour.

#### Season 10 - The End Raider

Despite being away traveling during the preparations for the End raid, Donut returned in time to participate in this server milestone. She joined [[WhoIsFishie]], [[ToadGod|ToadBlaze]], [[Perhaps]], [[Buhkiru]], [[StrawBwabii]], and [[TheHarryG|12OK]] in facing the modded Ender Dragon with its surprising new attack patterns.

Donut adapted quickly to the challenging fight, working cooperatively with other players to defeat the dragon. She then participated in raiding end cities for valuable shulker shells and elytra wings.

### Character Traits

#### The Animal Whisperer

What truly set Donut apart from other players was her extraordinary connection with animals. While others viewed pets as mere status symbols or portable storage, Donut treated each animal with genuine care.

Her ability to tame and manage numerous pets simultaneously became legendary, as did her determination to protect them from harm. This extended beyond gameplay to influence her social interactions - as evidenced by her refusal to represent [[Anoojfunaid]] after he killed a beloved server pet.

#### The Botanical Collector

Equally distinctive was Donut's passion for flora. She meticulously collected specimens from every biome she visited, creating what eventually became the most comprehensive botanical collection on the server.

### Legacy

While Donut's journey on SarCraft began in Season 10, she quickly established herself as a player of significance through:

- Participation in the historic Four Corners Expedition
- Successful legal defense of [[WhoIsFishie]] in "The Trial of the Century"
- Creation of the server's most extensive botanical collection
- Participation in the Ender Dragon fight

For future SarCraft historians, Donut will likely be remembered not for conquests or wars, but for bringing a gentler presence to a chaotic server. Her botanical garden and animal sanctuaries stood in stark contrast to the typical fortresses and redstone war machines that dominated previous seasons.

### Relationships

- [[WhoIsFishie]]: Close ally and exploration partner, trusted Donut as his legal counsel during his trial
- [[StrawBwabii]]: Fellow prankster and building partner, engaged in death competitions and collaborative projects
- [[Buhkiru]]: Fellow Chicken Factory member who supported her explorations
- [[athphane]]: Complex relationship as both the judge she successfully argued before and later the target of her pranks
