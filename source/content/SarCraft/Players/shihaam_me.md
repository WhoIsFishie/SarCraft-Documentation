# The Reluctant Admin of SarCraft

In the chaotic and ever-evolving history of SarCraft, few figures loom as large as its creator and reluctant deity - **[[shihaam_me]]**. The architect of both the server's existence and its most infamous moments of catastrophe, Shihaam stands as a contradictory figure: all-powerful yet perpetually vulnerable, creator and destroyer, admin and noob.

## The Man Behind the Server

Legend has it that SarCraft began not as a grand vision for a multiplayer experience, but as [[shihaam_me]]'s humble attempt to impress a girl he liked. This origin story, shrouded in the mists of [[Season 0]], set the tone for what would become the server's defining characteristic - the unexpected consequences of simple decisions.

The creator of the iconic **[[SarCube]]** – an architectural marvel that has appeared across multiple seasons – Shihaam's building style has become as recognizable as his hands-off administrative approach. He prefers to observe from afar, descending into the fray only when the server teeters on the brink of anarchy.

## The Administrator Who Cannot Survive

Perhaps most infamous is Shihaam's staggering death count, a testament to his unfamiliarity with the very game he oversees. Players often joke that the true SarCraft experience includes witnessing Shihaam's latest demise at the hands of the most basic Minecraft hazards.

His deaths have become the stuff of server legend:

- Drowning while fleeing from [[WhoIsFishie]], who pursued him wielding nothing but a fish
- Being burned alive atop Mount Boobies during a bizarre sacrificial ritual
- Dying to thorns damage from [[WhoIsFishie]]'s armor during an attempted confrontation
- Perishing repeatedly to sky lava during Operation Bamboo

## The Technical Caretaker

Behind Shihaam's in-game incompetence lies a troubled history of server administration. The technical catastrophes that have defined SarCraft's tumultuous timeline often trace back to his doorstep:

- The accidental world deletion just 24 hours into [[Season 3]]
- The failed backup system that led to the infamous Reset of May 13 during [[Season 5]]
- The server bankruptcy of May 10 that required emergency player donations
- The SSH access loss during [[Season 6]] that gave birth to the unprecedented "IRL Arc"

Yet through each disaster, Shihaam maintains an almost supernatural ability to resurrect the server, bringing players back for more chaos with each new season.

## Administrative Philosophy: Strategic Apathy

Shihaam's approach to governance can best be described as "strategic apathy" - a calculated distance that allows factional politics to evolve naturally, interrupted only by occasional, earth-shattering interventions.

This philosophy was most clearly demonstrated during [[Season 5]]'s revolution, when he watched passively as [[WhoIsFishie]]'s forces surrounded his base with bamboo lag machines and obsidian traps. Only when pushed to his absolute limit did he reveal his true power.

## Season Highlights

### The First Sin ([[Season 0]])

The first-ever SarCraft court case was presided over after Shihaam committed what the server deemed a "major sin" - breeding [[Redacted]]'s cow with another cow without permission. This seemingly minor transgression established the precedent that would define SarCraft's peculiar moral compass for years to come.

### Admin Abandonment ([[Season 2]])

During the Post-Classical Age, Shihaam's extended absence allowed the [[Nazi]] faction to effectively take control of server operations, leading to widespread cheating and economic collapse. His return came only when revolution had already transformed the power structure.

### The Just Iron Incident ([[Season 3]])

In perhaps the most disproportionate administrative decision in server history, Shihaam banned [[Redacted]] over the theft of iron ingots - effectively ending the entire season after just thirteen days.

### The [[Season 5]] Power Trip

After being held hostage by revolutionary players in Season 5's "Operation Bamboo," Shihaam finally broke. When forced to provide compensation via commands, he discovered new powers that consumed him. For one glorious hour, he transformed from reluctant administrator to chaotic deity – flying in creative mode, randomly bestowing creative powers on unsuspecting players, smiting others on a whim, and unleashing an Ender Dragon into the overworld. This unprecedented display of admin abuse remains etched in server lore as "The Great Power Trip of Season 5," a cautionary tale of what happens when the server's most death-prone player discovers godmode.

### The Seed Controversy ([[Season 9]])

When [[iBattus]] accused [[WhoIsFishie]] of obtaining the server seed to locate structures, Shihaam's dismissive verdict - "Fishie doesn't have seed, Bassam is delusional" - only deepened factional tensions, setting the stage for the great war that would define Season 9.

## The Eternal Return

Despite trials that would break lesser administrators, Shihaam's resilience remains unmatched. He continues to rule SarCraft with a peculiar blend of apathy and sudden, godlike intervention – keeping players forever guessing what bizarre administrative decision might reshape their world next.

His continued presence through nine seasons stands as testament to an unwritten rule of SarCraft: the server may crash, factions may rise and fall, but Shihaam - and his cobblestone monstrosities - will always return.
