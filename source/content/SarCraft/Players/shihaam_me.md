The creator of the iconic **[[SarCube]]** – an architectural marvel that has appeared across multiple seasons – Shihaam's building style has become as recognizable as his hands-off administrative approach. He prefers to observe from afar, descending into the fray only when the server teeters on the brink of anarchy.

Perhaps most infamous is Shihaam's staggering death count, a testament to his unfamiliarity with the very game he oversees. Players often joke that the true SarCraft experience includes witnessing Shihaam's latest demise at the hands of the most basic Minecraft hazards.

Despite these trials, Shihaam's resilience remains unmatched. He continues to rule SarCraft with a peculiar blend of apathy and sudden, godlike intervention – keeping players forever guessing what bizarre administrative decision might reshape their world next.
### Season History

#### The Season 5 Power Trip

After being held hostage by revolutionary players in Season 5's "Operation Bamboo," Shihaam finally broke. When forced to provide compensation via commands, he discovered new powers that consumed him. For one glorious hour, he transformed from reluctant administrator to chaotic deity – flying in creative mode, randomly bestowing creative powers on unsuspecting players, smiting others on a whim, and unleashing an Ender Dragon into the overworld. This unprecedented display of admin abuse remains etched in server lore as "The Great Power Trip of Season 5," a cautionary tale of what happens when the server's most death-prone player discovers godmode.
