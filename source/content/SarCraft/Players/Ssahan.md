# Ssahan: The Shadow General

In the bloody annals of SarCraft history, few players have made such an immediate and lasting impact as **Ssahan**. Emerging from obscurity in [[Season 9]], this strategic mastermind quickly established himself as [[iBattus]]'s most loyal and effective lieutenant, executing some of the most devastating guerrilla warfare tactics the server has ever witnessed.

## The Mysterious Arrival

Unlike most players whose origins are well-documented, Ssahan's arrival on SarCraft was shrouded in mystery - at first. What many players didn't realize was that Ssahan is actually related to [[iBattus]] in real life. This blood connection explained his immediate alignment with [[iBattus]] and their exceptional coordination in battle.

Despite being new to the server, Ssahan's family connection to one of SarCraft's most notorious players gave him a thorough understanding of the server's history, politics, and mechanics before he ever logged in. [[iBattus]] had likely shared stories of past seasons, grudges, and tactical knowledge, preparing his relative for immediate effectiveness on the battlefield.

## Season 9: The Master Strategist

### The Formation of The Alliance

While [[iBattus]] had the notoriety and historical grudges, it was Ssahan who provided the tactical brilliance behind [[The Alliance]]'s operations. Together, they formed perhaps the smallest yet most effective fighting force in server history - a two-man army capable of terrorizing the much larger [[Fishie Land]] faction.
### The Intelligence Operations

Ssahan's genius first revealed itself through his reconnaissance missions against [[Fishie Land]]. What appeared to be failed espionage attempts - with Ssahan being discovered and forced to flee - were actually calculated intelligence gathering operations.

Each "failure" provided crucial information about [[Fishie Land]]'s defenses, response times, and tactical weaknesses. When caught and pursued, Ssahan would often resort to combat logging - a controversial tactic, but one that served his strategic purposes by preserving both his life and the intelligence he had gathered.

### The Devastating Counterattack

Ssahan's defining moment came during what would be known as "The Great War of Season 9." While [[iBattus]] deliberately drew the entire [[Fishie Land]] faction away from their base with a carefully timed login, Ssahan executed the real attack - infiltrating the undefended [[Fishie Land]] compound and detonating pre-placed TNT charges throughout, obliterating their farms and infrastructure.

The timing was impeccable - a counter-strike executed at the precise moment when all defenders were absent. This wasn't merely destruction; it was strategic brilliance that showcased Ssahan's understanding of timing, distraction, and opportunity.

### The Final Battle and Defeat

The war culminated in a final confrontation on the scarred grounds of [[Fishie Land]]. Despite their tactical superiority, Ssahan and [[iBattus]] found themselves outmatched in gear and numbers during their final assault.

As their armor began to fail and defeat seemed inevitable, Ssahan made a surprising call for peace:

The request came too late. For [[Anoojfunaid]], the death of [[Mika]] at [[iBattus]]'s hands demanded vengeance. Ignoring Ssahan's attempt at a ceasefire, [[Anoojfunaid]] continued the pursuit, eventually cornering and eliminating Ssahan in what would become one of the most iconic deaths in server history:

## Season 10: From Warrior to Hostage

### The Unexpected Peace

When Season 10 began, Ssahan returned alongside [[iBattus]] in a dramatically altered server landscape. The unthinkable had occurred - a peace agreement between [[iBattus]] and [[WhoIsFishie]], mortal enemies whose feud had defined SarCraft for half a decade.

For Ssahan, this presented a new role. No longer the shadow operative, he became a visible and active member of the reformed [[The Alliance]], which now included newer players like [[invisble715|Pumkin715]] and [[yeetuz]].

When the Telegram exploit was accidentally triggered, Ssahan was among those who received illegal items:

> "Players online during the exploit included:
> - [[Ssahan]] - 4 shells
> - [[WhoIsFishie]] - 4 shells (burned)
> - [[iBattus]] - 2 shells 
> - [[yeetuz]] - 4 shells 
> - [[invisble715|Pumkin715]] - 2 shells"

Unlike [[WhoIsFishie]], who immediately destroyed his shells, Ssahan's handling of these illegal items would later contribute to the growing suspicions between the factions.

### The PrincipleOf_AIS Incident

Ssahan's most controversial action in Season 10 came when he killed newcomer [[PrincipleOf_AIS]] under [[iBattus]]'s orders. This incident would lead to significant consequences for both Ssahan and [[iBattus]].

The trial, presided over by [[CatMDV]], resulted in a two-day ban for both players and requirements to provide compensation to [[PrincipleOf_AIS]] - a humiliating outcome that damaged the reputation of these once-feared warriors.

### The Hostage Crisis

Following his return to the server after the court case, Ssahan found himself in another dramatic situation that would become known as "The TSA Incident and Hostage Crisis."

The most shocking aspect of this ordeal was [[iBattus]]'s response - or lack thereof. Despite their real-life family connection and Ssahan's loyal service across two seasons, [[iBattus]] eventually abandoned negotiations for his release, telling the [[Chicken Factory]] to "Kill him" when they proposed further talks. This callous betrayal of blood ties stunned the server community and revealed the depths of [[iBattus]]'s ruthless pragmatism.

### The Jailbreak and Final Threat

In a last desperate act, Ssahan attempted a daring escape from his prison cell. The attempt failed dramatically, resulting in his death by fire. His first message to the server after this humiliating defeat revealed a darker side to the usually calculated warrior:

> "u lot gonna die soon."

This threat would be his last significant contribution to Season 10. Shortly thereafter, both Ssahan and [[iBattus]] were unwhitelisted from the server following them leaving the group chat.
## Combat Style and Tactics

### The Intelligence Gatherer

Unlike many SarCraft warriors who favored direct confrontation, Ssahan specialized in reconnaissance and intelligence gathering. His approach to conflict was methodical and patient - gathering information, identifying vulnerabilities, and striking only when conditions were optimal.

### The Demolitions Expert

Ssahan's signature tactic was the strategic placement of TNT for maximum destructive impact. Rather than using explosives for combat, he employed them against infrastructure and farms - targeting the economic foundations of enemy factions rather than the players themselves.

### The Tactical Retreater

When confronted with superior force, Ssahan wasn't above strategic withdrawal - including the controversial practice of combat logging. This pragmatic approach to survival allowed him to fight another day, though it earned him criticism from players who valued honor in combat above tactical advantage.

## Legacy

Ssahan's brief but impactful presence on SarCraft represents a study in contrasts. In [[Season 9]], he emerged as perhaps the server's most effective guerrilla warrior, executing the strategic devastation of [[Fishie Land]] with precision and cunning. Yet in [[Season 10]], his story became one of steadily diminishing agency - from feared operative to banned player to hostage and finally to unwhitelisted exile.

What remains remarkable about Ssahan's legacy is how quickly he established himself as a significant force on the server. Despite only participating in two seasons, he nevertheless managed to become a pivotal figure in some of the server's most dramatic conflicts.

For future SarCraft historians, Ssahan will be remembered as the tactical genius behind [[iBattus]]'s revenge - the shadow general whose strategic brilliance nearly toppled the mighty [[Fishie Land]] empire. Yet he will also serve as a cautionary tale about family loyalty, as even his blood connection to [[iBattus]] proved insufficient protection when [[iBattus]] coldly abandoned him to his fate during the hostage crisis.

In the ever-shifting alliances and enmities of SarCraft, Ssahan's story demonstrates a timeless truth: on the longest server in the Maldives, even family ties can be severed when self-preservation is at stake.
