# CatMDV: The Ancient Builder

In the tumultuous history of SarCraft, few players have maintained such a consistent presence through the server's many ages as **CatMDV** - known simply as "Cat" to the countless players who have witnessed his architectural contributions across multiple seasons.

## The Ancient Builder

One of the oldest players both in real-life years and server tenure, Cat first emerged during the chaotic days of [[Season 2]], where the factional warfare between the [[Nazi]] compound and other powers threatened to tear the server apart. While others sought power through conflict, Cat established himself as a neutral technical expert - a builder whose skills were so valuable that even the most hostile factions would grant him safe passage.

In exchange for mere diamonds and access to the infamous [[Nazi#Trading Chunk]], Cat constructed one of the first advanced iron farms on the server - a contraption so efficient it shifted the economic balance of power and cemented his reputation as a technical savant. This diplomatic achievement set the pattern for his future on the server - a player whose value transcended faction lines.

## Ideology and Alliance

Throughout the server's history, Cat has remained perhaps the most devoted follower of the [[Spawn Mason]] ideology. While others fought over territory and resources, Cat consistently returned to spawn on each new world, establishing essential infrastructure and community farms accessible to all players regardless of allegiance.

This philosophical stance positioned him uniquely in server politics - respected by the [[WhoIsFishie|revolutionary forces]] for his community contributions, yet trusted by administrative powers like [[iBattus]] and [[shihaam_me]] for his stabilizing presence.

## The Season 5 Renaissance

Cat's most significant contribution came during the tumultuous [[Season 5|Age of Revolution]], where he played an unexpected role as both builder and diplomat.

When the server first launched, Cat joined the original Spawn Masons alongside [[iBattus]] and [[invisble715]], establishing crucial farming infrastructure that would fuel the early economy. Under his leadership, this group constructed the humble spawn hut that would later witness the birth of a server-wide revolution.

Even as [[WhoIsFishie]]'s revolutionary forces later turned the server into a battleground, Cat maintained a position of technical neutrality, leading to him being left untouched by the revolution. 

## The Male' Project

Perhaps Cat's most ambitious (if ultimately unrealized) vision came during the later days of [[Season 5]], when he proposed building a 1:1 scale replica of Male' - the capital city - within Minecraft. This megaproject would have created a newsworthy achievement that transcended the typical server drama.

While the idea generated tremendous excitement, the sheer scale of the undertaking proved too massive even for Cat's dedication. The project remains legendary in server lore - a symbol of what might have been had the chaos of Server 5 not consumed all in its path.

## Legacy

Across multiple server resets and factional conflicts, Cat has remained a constant presence - the builder who returns when others have abandoned hope, consistently establishing new infrastructure at each spawn point, and teaching newcomers the values of the [[Spawn Mason]] ideology.

His technical knowledge has shaped the server's progression through each new season, with his farms and redstone contraptions often outlasting the conflicts that rage around them. While others might be remembered for their conquests or betrayals, Cat's legacy is etched into the very foundation blocks of SarCraft's most enduring structures.

In a server defined by revolution, admin abuse, and factional warfare, Cat stands as a rare example of a player who built more than he destroyed - creating a legacy that spans the entire history of SarCraft itself.
