Udit is the player responsible for creating the Telegram based auth system used on SarCraft

the auth plugin would play a large role in the server history from the 2 way chat system which shows the Sarcraft groupchat msgs in the game chat and game chat in the group chat
this would prove invaluable when it comes to preserving server history

the plugin would also cause alot of issues for the server [[Exploits#Identity Theft]] and [[Exploits#Coords Leak]]

the plugin would allow users to auth into the minecraft server by simply sending /auth in the group chat making the login process password less
