## The Rise and Fall of SarCraft's Most Controversial Admin

Few players in SarCraft history have experienced such dramatic shifts in fortune as **iBattus**. From community builder to disgraced administrator to vengeful warrior, his saga spans multiple seasons and encapsulates the chaos that defines SarCraft's unique culture.

### Season History

#### Season 4 - The Forgotten Beginning

iBattus made his first appearance during the short-lived [[Season 4]], joining alongside his future nemesis [[WhoIsFishie]]. Though this season lasted mere days before technical issues collapsed it, these two newcomers would go on to shape server history through their legendary rivalry.

#### Season 5 - The Spawn Mason and The Fall

During the infamous [[Season 5|Age of Revolution]], iBattus established himself as a prominent member of the Spawn Masons, working alongside [[CatMDV|Cat]] and [[invisble715]] to build essential infrastructure at spawn.

When the server experienced catastrophic data loss during the May 13th incident, iBattus became the voice of administrative intransigence, voting against player compensation and declaring such measures "unfair." This decision put him squarely in the crosshairs of [[WhoIsFishie]]'s revolutionary faction.

This fateful declaration marked the beginning of iBattus's downfall. When [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[flowerrthiccc]] ambushed him, iBattus combat-logged to avoid death - a dishonorable tactic that would become his signature move across multiple seasons. Upon his return, he found himself trapped in an obsidian prison, abandoned by fellow admin [[shihaam_me]].

In desperation, iBattus logged in on an alternative account to rescue himself - an act that epitomized the administrative corruption [[WhoIsFishie]]'s revolution sought to overthrow. When [[shihaam_me]] finally capitulated to the revolutionaries' demands, iBattus immediately resigned his administrative position in protest.

#### Season 6 - The Origins of Revenge

Following his humiliating defeat in Season 5, iBattus initially refused to join the new season. Only after extensive diplomatic negotiations did he agree to return, under the condition that "something different" would be implemented - leading to the introduction of the Origins mod.

Selecting the Shulk origin, iBattus gained the ability to store items within his body - an appropriate choice for a player known for hoarding power and resources. His rivalry with [[WhoIsFishie]] intensified when their factions raced to claim the Dragon Egg, with iBattus briefly securing victory before [[Chicken Factory]] spies infiltrated his ranks.

The season culminated in yet another embarrassing defeat when iBattus was discovered by [[Buhkiru]], leading to another combat log and obsidian imprisonment - history repeating itself in the cruelest fashion.

#### Season 9 - The Sweet Taste of Revenge

After multiple seasons of humiliation, Season 9 finally provided iBattus the opportunity for revenge he had long craved. Forming a two-person faction with newcomer [[Ssahan]], iBattus executed a brilliant military campaign against [[Fishie Land]].

In what would become known as "The Great War of Season 9," iBattus and Ssahan launched devastating raids against [[WhoIsFishie]]'s territory, destroying farms and infrastructure with strategic TNT placements. In perhaps his most psychologically devastating attack, iBattus killed [[Mika]], [[Fishie Land]]'s beloved pet - crossing a line that inflamed the conflict to unprecedented levels.

Though ultimately outmatched in the final battle, iBattus claimed moral victory in his mission to destroy [[Fishie Land]]. Rather than face defeat, he chose to never log into the server again - ending Season 9 on his own terms.

### Character Traits

#### The Engineer

Throughout his SarCraft career, iBattus demonstrated exceptional technical skill, particularly in building functional infrastructure. From the early Spawn Mason farms to elaborate bases, his constructions were always practical if not always aesthetically pleasing.

#### The Tactician

Despite his numerous defeats, iBattus showed remarkable strategic thinking. His coordination with [[Ssahan]] during the Season 9 raids demonstrated his evolution from a straightforward fighter to a calculated military tactician.

#### The Combat Logger

Perhaps iBattus's most defining characteristic was his tendency to disconnect during PvP encounters when defeat seemed imminent. This tactic, universally derided in Minecraft culture, became his trademark across multiple seasons and contributed significantly to his controversial reputation.

### Legacy

iBattus's journey through SarCraft history serves as a cautionary tale about the corrupting influence of power and the price of pride. From community builder to disgraced administrator to vengeful warrior, his evolution mirrors the server's own transition from peaceful cooperation to factional warfare.

Though his final act was to abandon the server rather than face defeat, iBattus's impact on SarCraft cannot be overstated. His rivalry with [[WhoIsFishie]] drove some of the most dramatic moments in server history, and his administrative abuses provided the catalyst for the revolutionary movements that would reshape SarCraft's political landscape forever.

In the pantheon of SarCraft legends, iBattus stands as neither hero nor villain, but as something more complex - a player whose ambition and pride created both moments of community brilliance and episodes of catastrophic destruction.
