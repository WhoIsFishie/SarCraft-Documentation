## The Rise and Fall of SarCraft's Most Controversial Admin

Few players in SarCraft history have experienced such dramatic shifts in fortune as **iBattus**. From community builder to disgraced administrator to vengeful warrior, his saga spans multiple seasons and encapsulates the chaos that defines SarCraft's unique culture.

### Season History

#### Season 4 - The Forgotten Beginning

iBattus made his first appearance during the short-lived [[Season 4]], joining alongside his future nemesis [[WhoIsFishie]]. Though this season lasted mere days before technical issues collapsed it, these two newcomers would go on to shape server history through their legendary rivalry.

#### Season 5 - The Spawn Mason and The Fall

During the infamous [[Season 5|Age of Revolution]], iBattus established himself as a prominent member of the Spawn Masons, working alongside [[CatMDV|Cat]] and [[invisble715]] to build essential infrastructure at spawn.

When the server experienced catastrophic data loss during the May 13th incident, iBattus became the voice of administrative intransigence, voting against player compensation and declaring such measures "unfair." This decision put him squarely in the crosshairs of [[WhoIsFishie]]'s revolutionary faction.

This fateful declaration marked the beginning of iBattus's downfall. When [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[flowerrthiccc]] ambushed him, iBattus combat-logged to avoid death - a dishonorable tactic that would become his signature move across multiple seasons. Upon his return, he found himself trapped in an obsidian prison, abandoned by fellow admin [[shihaam_me]].

In desperation, iBattus logged in on an alternative account to rescue himself - an act that epitomized the administrative corruption [[WhoIsFishie]]'s revolution sought to overthrow. When [[shihaam_me]] finally capitulated to the revolutionaries' demands, iBattus immediately resigned his administrative position in protest.

#### Season 6 - The Origins of Revenge

Following his humiliating defeat in Season 5, iBattus initially refused to join the new season. Only after extensive diplomatic negotiations did he agree to return, under the condition that "something different" would be implemented - leading to the introduction of the Origins mod.

Selecting the Shulk origin, iBattus gained the ability to store items within his body - an appropriate choice for a player known for hoarding power and resources. His rivalry with [[WhoIsFishie]] intensified when their factions raced to claim the Dragon Egg, with iBattus briefly securing victory before [[Chicken Factory]] spies infiltrated his ranks.

The season culminated in yet another embarrassing defeat when iBattus was discovered by [[Buhkiru]], leading to another combat log and obsidian imprisonment - history repeating itself in the cruelest fashion.

#### Season 9 - The Sweet Taste of Revenge

After multiple seasons of humiliation, Season 9 finally provided iBattus the opportunity for revenge he had long craved. Forming a two-person faction with newcomer [[Ssahan]], iBattus executed a brilliant military campaign against [[Fishie Land]].

In what would become known as "The Great War of Season 9," iBattus and Ssahan launched devastating raids against [[WhoIsFishie]]'s territory, destroying farms and infrastructure with strategic TNT placements. In perhaps his most psychologically devastating attack, iBattus killed [[Mika]], [[Fishie Land]]'s beloved pet - crossing a line that inflamed the conflict to unprecedented levels.

Though ultimately outmatched in the final battle, iBattus claimed moral victory in his mission to destroy [[Fishie Land]]. Rather than face defeat, he chose to never log into the server again - ending Season 9 on his own terms.

#### Season 10 - Truce, Treachery, and Exile

The unthinkable occurred at the dawn of Season 10 when iBattus and [[WhoIsFishie]] - mortal enemies for half a decade - negotiated peace. This momentous reconciliation shocked veterans who had witnessed their bitter feuds across multiple seasons.

> "After years of bitter rivalry spanning multiple seasons, [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]] – the server's most legendary antagonists – reached out across enemy lines to negotiate peace."

The truce enabled an unprecedented collaboration, with iBattus and [[WhoIsFishie]] working together to design mods that would fundamentally transform gameplay. Their partnership produced revolutionary changes. 

In a gesture of reconciliation, [[shihaam_me]] restored iBattus to his former administrative position - a dramatic reversal of fortune that gave him another chance at authority. Yet the peace would prove short-lived.

##### The Telegram Plugin Feud

Tensions emerged when iBattus rejected [[WhoIsFishie]]'s proposal for a more secure authentication system, preferring to stick with the notoriously exploitable Telegram plugin that had been a source of server vulnerabilities for years. The ensuing dispute collapsed their fragile truce, with both reverting to old antagonisms.

> "Who cares about what [[WhoIsFishie]] wants"

This dismissive statement from [[shihaam_me]], which iBattus supported, rekindled the old hostilities. When [[WhoIsFishie]] created a poll that showed overwhelming support for his position, the administrative alliance found itself on the defensive.

##### The Exploit and Evidence Controversy

When the Telegram plugin vulnerability was finally exploited, resulting in illegal items appearing on the server, iBattus saw an opportunity. Using his administrative powers, he inspected [[WhoIsFishie]]'s ender chest and claimed to discover an illegitimate shulker box - evidence he immediately posted in the group chat.

[[WhoIsFishie]] vehemently denied the accusation, claiming iBattus had planted the evidence to frame him. The controversy escalated into formal legal proceedings when three players were banned in connection with the exploit.

##### The State vs. Axis Trial

In what would become one of the most significant judicial proceedings in SarCraft history, iBattus found himself in the unfamiliar position of prosecutor rather than defendant. Working alongside [[shihaam_me]], he presented evidence against [[WhoIsFishie]], [[Anoojfunaid]], and [[Perhaps]].

The trial revealed deep flaws in iBattus's case when he was caught submitting misdated evidence, claiming certain logs were from February 5th when the server hadn't even launched until February 28th. This critical error undermined his credibility and shifted momentum toward the defense.

When [[shihaam_me]] himself sided against iBattus at several key moments, describing the prosecution's arguments as "a [[iBattus]] skill issue," the administrative alliance fractured publicly. By the trial's conclusion, [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[Perhaps]] were cleared of major charges, with Judge [[athphane]] determining the alleged shulker box was merely "purple concrete."

This judicial defeat represented another humiliating setback for iBattus, who found his evidence discredited and his administrative judgment questioned.

##### The PrincipleOf_AIS Incident

iBattus's most consequential action in Season 10 came when he ordered the killing of new player [[PrincipleOf_AIS]] for allegedly spying on [[The Alliance]]'s base. When [[PrincipleOf_AIS]] denied the accusations and later leaked the base coordinates in retaliation, iBattus escalated the situation by ordering the player's items burned.

This unusually cruel behavior toward a new player drew condemnation from the server community, particularly the [[Chicken Factory]]. The situation worsened when [[PrincipleOf_AIS]] accused [[The Alliance]] members of using hacked clients, leading [[shihaam_me]] to ban both iBattus and [[Ssahan]] pending a formal hearing.

The resulting trial, presided over by [[CatMDV]], resulted in a two-day ban for iBattus and a requirement to provide a full diamond set to the wronged player - another public humiliation.

##### The TSA Incident and Final Unwhitelisting

The final chapter of iBattus's Season 10 saga began when he was discovered trespassing in [[Chicken Factory]] territory. When confronted and asked to submit to a "TSA inspection" (inventory check), he refused, leading to a standoff.

The situation escalated dramatically when [[Ssahan]] was taken hostage by the [[Chicken Factory]], who demanded iBattus's compliance in exchange for his ally's freedom. Despite repeated appeals to [[shihaam_me]] for intervention, iBattus received no administrative support.

> "If u spam the kid dies," [[Perhaps]] warned, escalating the hostage situation.

The crisis reached its breaking point when iBattus eventually abandoned [[Ssahan]] to his fate, telling the [[Chicken Factory]] to "Kill him" when they proposed further negotiations. This callous dismissal prompted [[WhoIsFishie]] to remark that iBattus was "tryna make us catch a case."

In the aftermath, iBattus left the SarCraft group chat entirely, effectively withdrawing from server politics. His brief return to announce "wiping stuffs" triggered concerns of retaliatory destruction, leading [[shihaam_me]] to take the extraordinary step of unwhitelisting both iBattus and [[Ssahan]] from the server.

When questioned about his purpose for logging in, iBattus's final words to the server community revealed his bitterness: "you are bad admin, good for chicken factory."

With this unceremonious exit, iBattus's Season 10 journey ended not with a dramatic last stand, but with administrative removal - a fitting conclusion for a player whose SarCraft career had been defined by authority, its abuse, and its loss.
### Character Traits

#### The Engineer

Throughout his SarCraft career, iBattus demonstrated exceptional technical skill, particularly in building functional infrastructure. From the early Spawn Mason farms to elaborate bases, his constructions were always practical if not always aesthetically pleasing.

#### The Tactician

Despite his numerous defeats, iBattus showed remarkable strategic thinking. His coordination with [[Ssahan]] during the Season 9 raids demonstrated his evolution from a straightforward fighter to a calculated military tactician.

#### The Combat Logger

Perhaps iBattus's most defining characteristic was his tendency to disconnect during PvP encounters when defeat seemed imminent. This tactic, universally derided in Minecraft culture, became his trademark across multiple seasons and contributed significantly to his controversial reputation.

### Legacy

iBattus's journey through SarCraft history serves as a cautionary tale about the corrupting influence of power and the price of pride. From community builder to disgraced administrator to vengeful warrior to reluctant peacemaker and finally to exiled pariah, his evolution mirrors the server's own complex transitions.

His rivalry with [[WhoIsFishie]] drove some of the most dramatic moments in server history, from the Season 5 Revolution to the Season 8 Fish Bundy Trials to the Season 9 Great War to the Season 10 administrative controversies. Even in their brief alliance at the start of Season 10, their relationship defined server politics.

In the pantheon of SarCraft legends, iBattus stands as neither hero nor villain, but as something more complex - a player whose ambition and pride created both moments of community brilliance and episodes of catastrophic destruction. Perhaps most significantly, his inability to accept defeat gracefully - whether through combat logging, administrative abuse, or server abandonment - serves as his most enduring and controversial legacy.

Season 10's final judgment on iBattus came not from a dramatic battle or court verdict, but from the administrative decision to remove his access entirely - a quiet end to SarCraft's most dramatic antagonist.
