## The Architect and Prankster

### Season History

#### Season 5 - The Bridge Builder

StrawBwabii joined SarCraft during the infamous [[Season 5|Age of Revolution]], a turbulent period marked by conflict between [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]]. Rather than involving herself in the political struggles of the server, she focused on architecture and infrastructure projects.

Her most notable achievement from this era was a magnificent bridge that unfortunately fell victim to the catastrophic May 13th data loss incident, when the server reverted to an old backup. This project, despite its eventual loss, established her reputation as a skilled builder with an eye for aesthetically pleasing and functional designs.

#### Season 10 - The Builder's Renaissance

By Season 10, StrawBwabii had firmly established herself as one of the server's premier architects. She created several distinctive structures, including her iconic café that became a landmark of the server landscape.

During this season, she was present for several pivotal moments in server history. She attended "The Trial of the Century" as a civilian observer, witnessing the dramatic proceedings that determined the fate of [[WhoIsFishie]], [[Perhaps]], and [[Anoojfunaid]].

#### Season 10 - The Prankster

StrawBwabii revealed her mischievous side through various pranks across the server. Following the unwhitelisting of [[iBattus]] and [[Ssahan]], she partnered with [[Donut]] to egg [[athphane]]'s house and leave signs falsely blaming the removed players.

Her most notable shenanigans occurred during what server logs described as a "death competition" with [[Donut]], generating hundreds of "fell from a high place" messages over nearly an hour. This bizarre activity drew even server moderators into the chaotic fun, with [[Buhkiru]] joining in by killing the players with various named weapons.

### Character Traits

#### The Visionary Architect

StrawBwabii's most distinctive characteristic was her unique building style. Her structures combined aesthetic beauty with practical functionality, often incorporating natural elements and creative use of the newly added decoration blocks from the Week 4 modpack update.


#### The Animal Enthusiast

Like her friend [[Donut]], StrawBwabii showed a clear affinity for Minecraft's animals. 

This connection to animals extended to her building projects, which often incorporated pet-friendly spaces and animal pens with decorative elements that went beyond mere functionality.

### Legacy

StrawBwabii's contribution to SarCraft spans multiple seasons, from her early bridge building in Season 5 to her continued architectural endeavors in Season 10. Her legacy includes:

- Creating distinctive architectural projects that enhanced the server's visual landscape
- Developing her iconic café and base
- Participating in the historic first modded Ender Dragon defeat
- Maintaining a playful, collaborative presence that counterbalanced the server's more dramatic political conflicts

For future SarCraft historians, StrawBwabii represents an important type of player often overlooked in server chronicles—those who focus on creation and community rather than conflict, yet still participate in key server events.
