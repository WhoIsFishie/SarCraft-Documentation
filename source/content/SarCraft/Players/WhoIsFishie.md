### Season History
#### Season 5

During the infamous fifth season, Fishie emerged as a calculating and ruthless figure known simply as "The Tax Man." What began as a seemingly innocent roleplay quickly evolved into something far more sinister.

"Pay your taxes or pay with your life." These words would echo through the server as Fishie established his dominion. With an iron fist, he collected "taxes" from all who crossed his path, amassing wealth through intimidation and force. His territory became a no-man's land where trespassers would be eliminated without warning, their items confiscated as "overdue payments."

Players would construct elaborate underground tunnels just to bypass Fishie's territory, knowing that being spotted meant certain death and the loss of all their valuables.

#### Season 6

The sixth season saw Fishie evolve into something truly nightmarish. Initially selecting the spider origin, he utilized his abilities to create an intricate web of surveillance [[Chicken Factory#Balls island]]

These seemingly random web placements were actually part of a sophisticated tracking system. Like a predator sensing vibrations on its web, Fishie could detect unsuspecting players who disturbed his trap, allowing him to hunt them down with terrifying efficiency.
#### Season 7 aka 6.5

Perhaps the most notorious chapter in Fishie's legacy came during Season 7 (also known as Season 6.5), when he and his faction "The Chicken Factory" executed what would become known as "The Great Server Hostage Crisis."

In an unprecedented act of anarchism, Fishie and his associates rigged the server spawn with TNT and threatened to crash the entire world.
#### Season 8

The eighth season introduced perhaps Fishie's most terrifying persona yet: Fish Bundy. Drawing inspiration from notorious real-world serial killers, Fish Bundy established a pattern of targeting new players, creating an atmosphere of dread for anyone joining the server.

What made Fish Bundy truly disturbing was his methodical approach. Each episode would feature a new victim, with Fishie developing increasingly elaborate methods of capturing and eliminating his prey. From suffocation to weaponizing the warden. 

In what would become known as "The Trial of the Century," Season 8 culminated in a server-wide spectacle when admins finally apprehended Fish Bundy and brought him before a hastily constructed courthouse. Players from across the server gathered to witness the proceedings, with many hoping to see justice for fallen friends.

In a shocking twist that left the server stunned, Fishie found himself in the unprecedented position of having to prove he had actually committed the very murders he was accused of. 

"I killed them all, and I can prove it!" Fishie reportedly shouted during cross-examination, producing screen recordings.

### Crimes

###### Las Vegas 

Amid the lawless expanses of the ocean lies Fishie's most closely guarded secret: Las Vegas. This isolated island fortress serves as both a monument to his criminal genius and a practical demonstration of his understanding of server mechanics.

Las Vegas houses two of Fishie's most valuable possessions: his legendary chicken collection and a hidden duplication stash containing items of immeasurable value. The island is ingeniously defended not by conventional means but by weaponized lag - thousands of chickens occupy the island, creating such severe performance issues that any would-be raiders find their clients crashing before they can even reach shore.
