## The Strategist Behind the Chicken Factory

WhoIsFishie stands as one of SarCraft's most influential players, whose evolution from violent tax collector to sophisticated strategist mirrors the server's own development. His legacy includes creating the powerful Chicken Factory faction, masterminding numerous server-defining events, and continuously adapting his tactics to maintain dominance across multiple seasons.

### Season History

#### Season 5 - The Tax Man

During the infamous fifth season, Fishie emerged as a calculating and ruthless figure known simply as "The Tax Man." What began as a seemingly innocent roleplay quickly evolved into something far more sinister.

> [!quote] "Pay your taxes or pay with your life."

These words would echo through the server as Fishie established his dominion. With an iron fist, he collected "taxes" from all who crossed his path, amassing wealth through intimidation and force. His territory became a no-man's land where trespassers would be eliminated without warning, their items confiscated as "overdue payments."

Players would construct elaborate underground tunnels just to bypass Fishie's territory, knowing that being spotted meant certain death and the loss of all their valuables.

#### Season 6 - The Spider

The sixth season saw Fishie evolve into something truly nightmarish. Initially selecting the spider origin, he utilized his abilities to create an intricate web of surveillance around [[Chicken Factory#Balls island]].

These seemingly random web placements were actually part of a sophisticated tracking system. Like a predator sensing vibrations on its web, Fishie could detect unsuspecting players who disturbed his trap, allowing him to hunt them down with terrifying efficiency.

#### Season 7 - The Hostage Taker

Perhaps the most notorious chapter in Fishie's legacy came during Season 7 (also known as Season 6.5), when he and his faction "The Chicken Factory" executed what would become known as "The Great Server Hostage Crisis."

In an unprecedented act of anarchism, Fishie and his associates rigged the server spawn with TNT and threatened to crash the entire world.

> [!note] This season marked the first time a player had successfully taken an entire server hostage, establishing Fishie's reputation for audacious server-scale operations

#### Season 8 - Fish Bundy

The eighth season introduced perhaps Fishie's most terrifying persona yet: Fish Bundy. Drawing inspiration from notorious real-world serial killers, Fish Bundy established a pattern of targeting new players, creating an atmosphere of dread for anyone joining the server.

What made Fish Bundy truly disturbing was his methodical approach. Each episode would feature a new victim, with Fishie developing increasingly elaborate methods of capturing and eliminating his prey, from suffocation to weaponizing the warden.

In what would become known as "The Trial of the Century," Season 8 culminated in a server-wide spectacle when admins finally apprehended Fish Bundy and brought him before a hastily constructed courthouse. Players from across the server gathered to witness the proceedings, with many hoping to see justice for fallen friends.

> [!quote] "I killed them all, and I can prove it!"

Fishie reportedly shouted during cross-examination, producing screen recordings that shocked the court.

#### Season 9 - The Strategic Defender

Season 9 saw a seemingly reformed Fishie declaring himself a pacifist ready to build rather than destroy. Establishing [[Fishie Land]] on an island directly in front of spawn allowed him to monitor all new players entering the world.

This strategic positioning wasn't accidental - it was another evolution in Fishie's approach to server dominance. Rather than actively hunting players, he created a power base that controlled the flow of new players into the server.

The massive deforestation project on the island wasn't for resources, but to establish unobstructed sightlines across his domain. Even in his "peaceful" era, Fishie was thinking tactically.

When [[iBattus]] launched his revenge attack on [[Fishie Land]], Fishie demonstrated his adaptability. Despite the destruction of his territory and the emotional devastation of losing his pet [[Mika]], Fishie led the reconstruction effort, rebuilding [[Fishie Land]] stronger than before.

> [!note] The loss of Mika at the hands of iBattus created one of the most emotional moments in server history, showing a rare vulnerable side to Fishie

#### Season 10 - The Puppet Master

The latest evolution of WhoIsFishie in Season 10 represents the culmination of his journey from violent tax collector to sophisticated puppet master working behind the scenes.

In perhaps his most surprising transformation, Season 10 marked the first season where Fishie didn't use any hacked clients. After making a personal agreement with [[Buhkiru]], he vowed to play it clean - a remarkable shift for a player notorious for his exploitation of every possible advantage.

With his new found ability to code Java mods, Fishie ascended to a new level of influence. Rather than merely exploiting the server's mechanics, he now helped shape them. As the only player with this capability, he collaborated with [[iBattus]] to create the fundamental gameplay changes for Season 10, including:

- Complete removal of diamond ore generation from the world
- Disabling of villager trading, eliminating the path to enchanted gear
- Sealing the Nether dimension for the first two weeks
- Disabling ender eye crafting to delay End access

These radical modifications weren't merely technical tweaks â€“ they represented a fundamental rethinking of SarCraft's economy and power structure, something no other player had the skills to accomplish.

Season 10 saw Fishie engage in his most elaborate operations yet. The creation of AXIS, a hidden group within the [[Chicken Factory]], operated with military-like precision and secrecy. Their use of coded language, secure communication, and need-to-know information distribution showed Fishie's evolution into a true strategic mastermind.

Perhaps most impressively, Fishie's Season 10 operations included sophisticated intelligence gathering powered by his custom-built tools. He developed:

- The Pet Owner Tracker mod to identify and track player pets across the server
- A Player Schedule Tracking system that analyzed login patterns to identify optimal raid times
- Duplication exploit mods 
- Custom reconnaissance tools for the account [[PrincipleOf_AIS]]

These technical intelligence tools, unique to Fishie's arsenal due to his coding abilities, showed his evolution from brute-force tactics to sophisticated cyber-espionage operations that no other player could replicate.

> [!quote] "The time has come to pass the torch."

In his final act on SarCraft, Fishie made perhaps his most surprising move - graceful retirement. After five seasons of dominance, he officially stepped back, passing leadership of the [[Chicken Factory]] to [[Buhkiru]].

### Character Traits

#### The Adaptable Tactician

Throughout his SarCraft career, Fishie demonstrated an unparalleled ability to evolve his tactics to match changing circumstances. From direct confrontation in Season 5 to sophisticated intelligence operations in Season 10, his approach constantly evolved to maintain his edge over opponents.

#### The Technical Innovator

Fishie consistently pushed the boundaries of what was possible within Minecraft's mechanics. From weaponizing lag with chicken farms to developing mods that changed core gameplay, his technical knowledge allowed him to operate at a level beyond most players.

#### The Master Modder

Uniquely among SarCraft players, Fishie possessed the ability to write custom Java mods for the server. This rare talent elevated him from merely playing within the server's constraints to actively reshaping them. His technical creations included:

- The `REDACTED INFO.jar` mod that automated the "==REDACTED INFO== Exploit" for item duplication
- The Server Mapping Project and LightMap tool that identified potential base locations by analyzing light sources
- The Pet Owner Tracker mod for intelligence gathering
- Season 10's gameplay-changing mods that removed diamond generation and altered progression

This coding ability made him not just a player but a literal game-changer, capable of bending the server's mechanics to his will in ways no other player could match.

### Evolution of Combat Style

Throughout the seasons, Fishie's combat approach evolved dramatically:

- **Season 5:** Direct confrontation and intimidation
- **Season 6:** Trap-based combat using mechanical advantages
- **Season 7:** Terrorist-style threats and server-wide leverage
- **Season 8:** Exploitation of server mechanics for hunting
- **Season 9:** Defensive warfare and resilience
- **Season 10:** Proxy warfare through intelligence and planning

### Crimes

#### Las Vegas 

Amid the lawless expanses of the ocean lies Fishie's most closely guarded secret: Las Vegas. This isolated island fortress serves as both a monument to his criminal genius and a practical demonstration of his understanding of server mechanics.

![[Illegal island.png]] _The infamous lag-inducing chicken island known as Las Vegas_

Las Vegas houses two of Fishie's most valuable possessions: his legendary chicken collection and a hidden duplication stash containing items of immeasurable value. The island is ingeniously defended not by conventional means but by weaponized lag - thousands of chickens occupy the island, creating such severe performance issues that any would-be raiders find their clients crashing before they can even reach shore.

Built during the events of [[Season 5]], this remains one of his most notorious creations.

#### La Monument

Entering the era of peace and after draining a monument ([[Declassified Season 10 operations#4.3 AXIS HIDEOUT]]), Fishie decided to make a proper base.

This would be a large scale project as Fishie was unsatisfied using exploits and not building something cool.

> [!quote] "If we are gonna go through all this effort to do illegal shit might as well build cool stuff"

![[fishie_base.webp]]

This would lead to a large ocean monument on the western world border being drained and having its blocks be replaced with red and black blocks.
### Legacy

From Tax Man to Spider to Hostage Taker to Serial Killer to Strategic Defender to Puppet Master, WhoIsFishie's evolution tracks the development of SarCraft itself - from simple survival world to complex political landscape where technical knowledge, strategic planning, and psychological warfare determined success far more than sword skill or resource gathering.

In the anarchic world of SarCraft, WhoIsFishie didn't just play the game - he redefined what was possible within it, leaving an indelible mark on server history that will be remembered long after his departure.

### Relationships

- [[iBattus]]: Primary rival across Seasons 5-10, with a brief alliance in early Season 10 that quickly deteriorated
- [[Buhkiru]]: Loyal second-in-command and eventual successor to Chicken Factory leadership
