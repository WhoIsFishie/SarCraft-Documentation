## The Original Antagonist: From Admin to Deposed Dictator

Few names in SarCraft lore evoke as much controversy as Redacted. From the server's earliest days to the dramatic democratic revolution that ended his reign, Redacted's journey represents the darker currents that have always flowed beneath SarCraft's chaotic surface.

### Season History

#### Season 0 - The Founding

According to the sparse documentation of [[Season 0]], Redacted was the second player to ever join SarCraft, arriving after only [[shihaam_me]] himself. The server chronicles note:

> "[[shihaam_me]] created the server to play minecraft with a girl he liked. [[Redacted]] was the second player to join the server to keep the server active."

This early period was relatively peaceful, though it did witness the first of many server court cases - "the case of the [[Cow Ziney]]" - in which Redacted accused shihaam_me of breeding his cow with another cow, "seen as a great sin." The outcome of this first legal proceeding was never documented.

Season 0 ended dramatically when shihaam_me killed Redacted by "going into creative and throwing a potion of harming" - establishing a pattern of admin abuse and factional conflict that would define much of SarCraft's future.

#### Season 1 - The Faction Founder

In [[Season 1]], Redacted maintained his independence from shihaam_me, establishing a base "about 1000 blocks away" from the admin. During this period, the server witnessed the formation of its first major factions, including:

- The [[Weebs]]
- [[Holy Knights of the Templars|CHSE]]
- [[Nazi]]

Though the server documentation doesn't explicitly state which faction Redacted founded, subsequent season information strongly suggests his leadership of the Nazi faction, which would later become infamous not for political ideology but for their "concentration camp like villager trading systems."

#### Season 2 - The Rise to Power

[[Season 2]] marked Redacted's ascension to true power on the server. With shihaam_me largely absent from administrative duties, Redacted and the [[Nazi]] faction effectively took control of server operations, creating an era that would become known as the "Post Classical Age: AI and Hacks."

As one of the original administrators alongside [[shihaam_me]], Redacted wielded significant power on the server. He used this administrative authority to benefit his faction while [[shihaam_me]] was largely absent, creating a clear conflict of interest that would ultimately lead to server-wide discontent.

Under Redacted's leadership, the Nazi faction demonstrated exceptional technical prowess:

> "Nazi faction players often build over engineered structures. They can be found riding horses with max speed and max health. If you see a random chunk missing chances are there is a player nearby prepping for a villager slave chamber. If there is an exploit chances are Nazi players are exploiting it."

Their most notable achievement was the "Trading Chunk" - an entire chunk dug to bedrock with a villager breeder at the top and multiple floors of trading rooms below.

The faction's dominance extended beyond economic power. When they intercepted communications about the [[Weebs]]' plans to raid the End dimension, the Nazi faction executed "the first documented SarCraft speedrun" to defeat the Ender Dragon first, securing the coveted Dragon Egg as "an undeniable symbol of their supremacy."

#### The Overthrow and Administrative Removal

Redacted's reign came to an end when [[ToadGod]], "disgusted by the proliferation of cheating and the economic devastation," began a movement to overthrow the Nazi leadership. In a server-wide vote that would change the course of SarCraft history, players from all factions - even members of the Nazi faction itself - voted to depose Redacted.

This democratic revolution didn't just remove him from factional leadership â€“ it also stripped him of his administrative privileges, setting a precedent that would later influence server governance in future seasons. The removal of an admin through player action was unprecedented in SarCraft history.

> "The revolution had succeeded, but at a cost - Season 2 itself became a casualty of the political upheaval."

#### Season 3 - The Bitter Return

Despite his deposition, Redacted returned for [[Season 3]], his resentment clearly undiminished. Within 24 hours of the new season's launch, he enacted his revenge in what would become known as the "Just Iron Incident":

> "[[Redacted]], still bitter from the revolution that had deposed him, stumbled upon a vulnerable [[shihaam_me]] attempting to leave spawn. What followed was swift and merciless. Without hesitation, [[Redacted]] struck down the administrator, pilfering his iron ingots before fleeing into the wilderness."

This act of aggression planted "seeds of resentment that would ultimately doom the season." Redacted proceeded to reform the Nazi faction by recruiting [[Nausham]] and [[GurdhaanRamzee]], who had broken away from the [[Spawn Mason]]s over security concerns.

The reformed faction soon found itself in dire straits when Redacted became trapped in a cave system. The resulting "Operation Search and Rescue" ended in "catastrophic failure, with all three players perishing in the darkness."

Undeterred, Redacted led the Nazi faction on "The Great Migration" to secure the End portal, and in the process discovered a powerful duplication glitch that allowed them to create unlimited resources.

The season culminated in "The Diamond Penis Incident," where the Nazi faction constructed an enormous diamond phallus in front of [[ToadGod]]'s base, triggering a heated dispute that escalated to the server's first formal trial. During these proceedings, Redacted claimed:

> "I don't think we need his perms to build on the land just because its within the render distance of his base... we scouted the area to build and most places were full of creeper holes and it was unsafe to build so we settled on the island... we cleared out the land and flattened it i believe we should be able to keep the land we worked on."

The dispute proved to be the final straw for [[shihaam_me]], who banned Redacted from the server, citing the "Just Iron" incident as the official reason. The ban led to the collapse of Season 3 after just thirteen days.

### Character Traits

#### The Technical Innovator

Throughout his SarCraft career, Redacted demonstrated exceptional technical knowledge, particularly in exploiting game mechanics for maximum efficiency. From the "Trading Chunk" to various duplication glitches, his engineering prowess was undeniable, if often directed toward questionable ends.

#### The Power Consolidator

Redacted consistently worked to consolidate power, whether through faction building, resource hoarding, or exploit abuse. When administrative authority was weak or absent, he quickly moved to fill the vacuum, establishing himself as the de facto ruler of the server.

#### The Grudge Holder

Perhaps Redacted's most defining characteristic was his inability to let go of perceived slights. His vindictive actions after being deposed - particularly the "Just Iron Incident" - demonstrated a player who would sacrifice server stability for personal vengeance.

### Legacy

Redacted's influence on SarCraft history extends far beyond his active participation. As one of the server's original players, administrators, and its first true antagonist, he established patterns of faction warfare, resource monopolization, and exploitation that would define server politics for seasons to come.

#### Permanent Exile

Perhaps the most significant aspect of Redacted's legacy is that he remains the only player in SarCraft history to receive a permanent ban. Following his removal from Season 3, Redacted was never allowed to return to the server in any capacity - making his exile uniquely absolute in a community that otherwise frequently welcomed back former antagonists.

While other villainous figures like [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]] would return after their most infamous actions (with [[WhoIsFishie]] even becoming the dominant force in later seasons), Redacted's banishment remained permanent - a testament to how thoroughly he had alienated both the player base and [[shihaam_me]] himself.

This permanent exile serves as a stark contrast to SarCraft's typical pattern of cyclical conflict and redemption, where most players are eventually allowed to return regardless of their past transgressions.

#### The Dragon Egg Legacy

Perhaps Redacted's most lasting contribution to SarCraft culture was establishing the Dragon Egg as the server's ultimate trophy. His Nazi faction's race to secure it before the Weebs created a tradition that would echo through every subsequent season, with dominant players like [[iBattus]] and [[WhoIsFishie]] feeling compelled to organize their own End raids to claim this symbolic prize.

In [[Season 6]], this tradition reached its peak when [[WhoIsFishie]]'s [[Chicken Factory]] and [[iBattus]]'s faction engaged in an elaborate spy operation and counter-operation centered entirely around securing the Dragon Egg. What began as Redacted's power play had evolved into perhaps the most important ritual in SarCraft culture - a rite of passage that every aspiring faction leader felt obligated to complete.
#### Lasting Impact

The democratic revolution that removed Redacted from power set a precedent for player governance that would later resurface in [[WhoIsFishie]]'s Season 5 rebellion. Yet ironically, both [[WhoIsFishie]] and [[iBattus]] would inherit different aspects of Redacted's approach to server politics.

[[iBattus]] in a way mirrors Redacted. His rise to administrative power and subsequent abuse of that authority during Season 5 mirrored Redacted's own trajectory, creating a cycle of corruption and revolution that defined SarCraft's political landscape. Most tellingly, during Season 9, iBattus's bombing campaign against Fishie Land - where he systematically destroyed infrastructure and killed a beloved pet - demonstrated that he had inherited Redacted's capacity for vindictive destruction when seeking revenge, continuing the tradition of dramatic villainy that Redacted had established seasons earlier.

Meanwhile, [[WhoIsFishie]] inherited Redacted's flair for dramatic villainy and factional dominance, albeit with a revolutionary twist inspired by [[ToadGod]]'s democratic ideals. The [[Chicken Factory]]'s monopolistic tactics and exploitation of glitches echo strategies first pioneered by Redacted's Nazi faction, even as their revolutionary justifications borrowed from ToadGod's rhetoric of fairness and equity.

This curious blending of influences - with both major players incorporating elements of Redacted's villainous playbook while claiming the moral high ground established by ToadGod - created the unique political dynamic that would define later seasons of SarCraft.

In the pantheon of SarCraft villains, Redacted stands as the original - a player whose commitment to being the server's antagonist was so complete that his lifetime ban became necessary for the server to move forward. While later figures would emerge as morally complex characters with both heroic and villainous actions, Redacted remains SarCraft's purest archetype of antagonism - a necessary evil that gave the server community something to unite against.
