the Nazi's got their name for the concentration camp like villager trading systems they owned.
they were famous for their extremely efficient villager breeding and trading chunk. 

#### Ideology 
Nazi faction players often build over engineered structures. 
they can be found riding horses with max speed and max health
if you see a random chunk missing chances are there is a player nearby prepping for a villager slave chamber 
if there is an exploit chances are Nazi players are exploiting it

#### Trading Chunk

this is a entire chunk dug all the way to bedrock which has a breeder at the top floor and the rest of the floors being filled with trading rooms

#### Breakup
by the end of [[Season 2]] all members of the faction voted against the leader of the faction leading to the faction being killed off for a short period of time until they are revived again in [[Season 3]]
