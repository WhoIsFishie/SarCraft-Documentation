## Season History

### Season 10

the alliance would have 3 active players in season 10 including [[Ssahan]], [[iBattus]] and [[yeetuz]]

their base would survive being barely spotted by [[WhoIsFishie]] during his west world border trip. missing buy just a few chunks

during the telegram exploit their base would get leaked and agents would be sent to spy on their base

this would be one of the few evidence of the base before it got erased.
