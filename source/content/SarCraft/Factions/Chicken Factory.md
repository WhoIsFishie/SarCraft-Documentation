A group founded by [[WhoIsFishie]] after discovering a Shulkabox duplication exploit that was used to duplicate a bunch of eggs. the groups was informally created back in [[Season 5]] but would later be formally registered

Chicken factory is one of the largest factions on the server so far with their main goals always being to collect the dragon egg.

chances are if there is an exploit on the server the chicken factory will have it abused

## Standard Issue Chicken Kit
the standard issue chicken kit is a shulker box given to all members of the chicken factory containing  

- netherite gear 
- xp bottles
- golden carrots
- golden apples
- crystals 
- echest
- etc

## Season 6
the chicken factory is officially formed in this season    
leading up to [[Season 6]] [[shihaam_me]] would note that the chicken factory was too powerful

[[shihaam_me]], [22-Jun-22 4:56 PM]
You seem to have a lot of powers on my polls

[[shihaam_me]], [22-Jun-22 4:56 PM]
I need something against the chicken factory

#### New members
[[Nausham]] gets recruited to the chicken factory as a spy who pretends to join [[iBattus]]'s crew
[[Anoojfunaid]] gets recruited to help with building and vote manipulation 
[[FlameXode]] gets recruited as [[WhoIsFishie]]'s drug dealer since he cant eat golden apples so flame's job is to brew pots for [[WhoIsFishie]]

#### Shadow Server
the chicken factory would host a exact copy of [[Season 6]] world on a private server where they would test out exploits and build plans. this server would be used multiple times to discover exploits to be used on the main server as well as practice origins strats

#### BallsBuster 3000
![[balls_buster3000.mp4]]    
this is a early footage of the trap being tested on the [[Chicken Factory#Shadow Server]] which would later be improved to kill a full netherite player in a few hits. the trap would later be build all around the base to kill anyone coming too close to the base

the trap depended on lagging out a player in first person mode so hard that they cant move away in time 

## Season 10
seasons later the sleeping giant awakens

![[factory_base.webp]]

the players would travel north to set base on top of a hill 

during season 10 the factory would take control of all of the server votes bringing much needed changes such as one player sleep as well as disabling phantoms 

the factory would also use its influence to open up the first ever [[SAR_Shop]] to buy the globe pattern as it cant be accessed due to villagers being banned. 

the Chicken hill as it would be known would come to be the center of the small village that built around it

[[Buhkiru]]'s base being the house on top of the hill with a small pond and farm to its right as well as custom 2 cherry trees both sides of the house


![[bridge.jpg]] 
a bridge would be build that would connect the hill to [[TheHarryG|12OK]]'s base that was a few hundred blocks from the hill


![[donut_stairs.webp]]
[[Donut]] would build her staircase that went down hill that would connect to her flower garden which you had to go through to enter her hobbit base that was carved into a mountain

![[StrawBwabii_cafe.webp]]
nearby to [[Donut]] [[StrawBwabii]] would setup her base and her cafe' at the foot of the hill as well where she would keep her dogs and serve the players with lovely treats sold at her cafe'

![[jap_town_1.webp]]

to the east of the hill [[Buhkiru]] would build some Japanese style houses and a garden 

![[factory_east_view.jpg]]

a tunnel would be built underground by [[WhoIsFishie]] which would connect the hill to spawn as well as his temp base

![[hills_top_view.jpg]]

by the end of season 10 the area would be nicely populated and had a community feel to it.

![[cf_village.webp]]

the chicken factory village was well protected geographically as the trip to there from spawn is almost 5000 blocks away as well as the rough snowy mountains that acted as walls for the base.
