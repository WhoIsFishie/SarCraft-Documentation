A group founded by [[WhoIsFishie]] after discovering a Shulkabox duplication exploit that was used to duplicate a bunch of eggs. the groups was informally created back in [[Season 5]] but would later be formally registered

Chicken factory is one of the largest factions on the server so far with their main goals always being to collect the dragon egg.

chances are if there is an exploit on the server the chicken factory will have it abused


## Season 6
